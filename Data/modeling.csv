it’s like working with a completely different company that has no idea what they’re doing, not trillion dollar behemoth that built its business on a reputation for stellar customer support. this instance was the worst one, but things like this have happened to me regularly. the support in store has been less than stellar as well. it’s extremely un-apple like and i no longer view apple’s customer service as the cream of the crop, industry best standard that i used to, which is disappointing as it’s something i’d come to rely on as an owner and regular purchaser of many, many apple products. it’s ridiculous and unacceptable that i need to follow up on every single support request because it has a problem.

2,25,1612136462,1,"i just have to get this off my chest because i've just spent a good deal of time trying to bargain with apple to help me out and they literally give zero shits so here i am, doing what people do, and shouting into this void we call the internet.

backstory - i, like i'm sure many, many of you out there, am struggling to make ends meet. i'm a freelance audio professional and while i used to make a pretty comfortable living, the pandemic has cut my business in half. this month, i haven't paid a bunch of my bills and the work i have done in the past month is just going to cover my rent and bills with nothing really left over for food or general comforts. all of a sudden, a random client came my way with the budget to pay me a fee that would solve all my problems, at least in the short term. i gladly accepted the gig, even though the time crunch would mean working like an absolute madman to get it done by the deadline (which is now tomorrow, end of day). 

the day before yesterday, i was actually making incredible progress and feeling like i might actually have extra time left to really polish the work and provide something great when bam - my cat jumps up on the table, knocks over my full cup of coffee and absolutely soaks the one thing that allows me to do my job - my laptop. after screaming and scaring the shit out of my (asshole) cat, i quickly turn off the computer, start mopping up whatever i can and trying to clear any liquid out of vents, keys, thunderbolt ports, you name it. i place the computer upside down to dry for 24 hours and just start praying. all the work is backed up but without this computer i'm fucked.

next day, i gingerly turn on the computer and - yay! - it turns on and seems to work problem free. so i plug my peripherals back in, preparing to start work, but i notice when i plug in the charging cable theres a lack of that now familiar soft ""boong"" sound. no little lightning bolt symbol over the battery charge indicator. shit...ok. try the other ports. nada. the laptop isn't charging. so i think to myself - fine i can get this shit done and send the files before the battery drains! right? wrong, as i begin my furious dash to the finish line, the battery level is draining faster than i can work. i soon realize that i may indeed be totally f'd. so, i look at the local apple store, serving customers on an appointment-only bases and theres no appointments today (yesterday). i have apple care + so i call apple support, to see if theres something they can do for me. of course the only real solution is to have the computer fixed or replaced so i'm feeling dejected, but as i'm speaking with the apple support person he tells me a slot has just opened up for a 6pm appointment! ""would you like to --"" hell yes book that shit right away!

so i go to the apple store, explain my predicament, but long story short, because of covid, i have to leave the computer with them for up to 24 hours just to get a diagnoses done. fine what else can i do? i go home, try and relax and tell myself there must be a solution. 

today, they call and say it needs extensive repairs and that the parts aren't readily available. will take 5-10 days. i'm close to crying (internally of course - i'm not tryna traumatize this poor apple store employee). i'm going to lose this client though. i'm going to let them down on a job i guaranteed i would complete. i'm going to make the person who referred me look bad. this is fucked. so here's where things turned from me feeling totally depressed to actually being incredibly angry at apple.

look - i know this is essentially my fault, and i shouldn't feel entitled to have my problem solved by apple. but the thing is, i do, i guess, feel entitled. i've been an apple user for my whole life. my dad was a graphic designer and was an early adopter to apple computers at a time when many companies were still using markers and letraset. i grew up with macs. as an adult professional, i would estimate that i've spent $60,000 dollars on apple computers and products. i've bought applecare every time and have probably used it once for a hardware failure. not only that, but i've worked for companies and with people where they have switched an entire company's worth of employees over to apple computers at my recommendation. i've taken impeccable care of my devices in each and every case. i don't expect apple to know this or have some sort of list of long-term, die-hard apple pro users (though that would be nice!). but i did, in the humblest, briefest terms possible, explain all this to the rep at the apple store when we spoke this morning. she seemed genuinely interested in helping me and said she would see what she could do, and talk to the store managers once they got out of their 3pm meeting. but alas - they didn't give a fuck and she told me there was nothing she could do to help.

here's a couple reasonable solutions as i see it - 1. just give me a replacement computer. min is less than a year old, top of the line, and could easily be resold as a refurbished device for nearly the same cost. 2. offer me the trade-in value of my computer towards purchasing another computer. probably cheaper than the labour and shipping on the parts you're ordering to fix mine. anyone else think of any solutions that aren't ""go fuck yourself?"".

today, i would like to further elaborate on that.

*tl;dr*  
*apple will be moving to arm based macs in what i believe are 4 stages, starting around 2015 and ending around 2023-2025: release of t1 chip macbooks, release of t2 chip macbooks, release of at least one lower end model arm macbook, and transitioning full lineup to arm. reasons for each are below.*

apple is very likely going to switch to switch their cpu platform to their in-house silicon designs with an arm architecture. this understanding is a fairly common amongst various apple insiders. here is my personal take on how this switch will happen and be presented to the consumer.

the first question would likely be “why would apple do this again?”. throughout their history, apple has already made two other storied cpu architecture switches - first from the motorola 68k to powerpc in the early 90s, then from powerpc to intel in the mid 2000s. why make yet another? here are the leading reasons:

* intel  has, in recent years, been making significant losses both in reputation and in actual product value, as well as velocity of product development, breaking their bi-yearly “tick tock” cycle for the first time in decades. most recently, they have fallen well behind amd’s processor lines in cost to performance ratio, cpu core count, core design (monolithic design vs “chiplet”), power consumption to performance, silicon supply (intel with significant manufacturing process and yield issues), and on-silicon security features. while intel still wins out in certain enterprise and datacenter applications, as well as having a much better reputation for reliability and qa (amd having shipped numerous chips with a broken random- number generator that prevented even booting some mainstream operating system), the number of such applications slowly dwindles with each new release from amd, and as confidence among decisionmakers in enterprise increases. in the public consciousness, intel is quickly becoming a point of ridicule against apple’s mac lineup, rather than a badge of honor.
* by moving to their own designs, apple will be free from intel’s release schedule, which have recently been unpredictable and faced with routine delays due to poor manufacturing yields. apple will be able to update their mac lineup on their own timeline, rather than being forced to delay products based on intel’s ability to meet the release window. this also allows them to leverage relationships with other silicon fabricators to source chips, rather than relying on intel ’s continued “iteration” that’s leading to a “14nm++++++++++” process, or the continued lack of product diversity with the 10nm process. apple will also be free to innovate in the design of the silicon platform, rather than being limited by intel’s design choices. by having full control of the manufacturing and development cycle, apple can bring even more in-house optimization to the macos, as they have been for ios and ipados over the years.
* using an arm architecture on the macs allows for a more unified apple ecosystem, rather than having separate mac and ios-based products. the only distinction will be the device form factor and performance characteristics.
* the x86\_64 architecture is very old and inefficient, using older methodologies for processor design (cisc vs arm’s risc), and the instruction set continues to require support in silicon for emulating 1980s-vintage 16-bit modes, as well as ineffectual and archaic memory addressing modes (segmentation, etc.) the x86\_64 architecture is like a city, built atop a much older city, built atop a yet older city, but every layer is built with nyc infrastructure levels of complexity that suited its time and no further.
* over the last 10 years, apple has shown that they can consistently produce impressive silicon designs, often leading the market in performance and capability, and apple has been aggressively acquiring silicon design talent.

a common refrain heard on the internet is the suggestion that apple should switch to using cpus made by amd, and while this has been considered internally, it will most likely not be chosen as the path forward, even for their megalithic giants like the mac pro. even though amd would mitigate intel’s current set of problems, it does nothing to help the issue of the x86\_64 architecture’s problems and inefficiencies, on top of jumping to a platform that doesn’t have a decade of proven support behind it. why spend a lot of effort re-designing and re- optimizing for amd’s platform when you can just put that effort into your own, and continue the vertical integration apple is well-known for?

i believe that the internal development for the arm transition started around 2015/2016 and is considered to be happening in 4 distinct stages. these are not all information from apple insiders; some of these these are my own interpretation based off of information gathered from supply-chain sources, examination of macbook schematics, and other indicators from apple.

# stage1 (from 2014/2015 to 2017):

the rollout of computers with apple’s t1 chip as a coprocessor. this chip is very similar to apple’s t8002 chip design, which was used for the apple watch series 1 and series 2. the t1 is primarily present on the first touchid enabled macs, 2016 and 2017 model year macbook pros.

considering the amount of time required to design and validate a processor, this stage most likely started around 2014 or 2015, with early experimentation to see whether an entirely new chip design would be required, or if would be sufficient to repurpose something in the existing lineup. as we can see, the general purpose arm processors aren’t a one- trick pony.

to get a sense of the decision making at the time, let’s look back a bit. the year is 2016, and we're witnessing the beginning of stagnation of intel processor lineup. there is not a lot to look forward to other than another “+” being added to the 14nm fabrication process. the macbook pro has used the same design for many years now, and its age is starting to show. moving to amd is still very questionable, as they’ve historically not been able to match intel’s performance or functionality, especially at the high end, and since the “ryzen” lineup is still unreleased, there is absolutely no benchmarks or other data to show they are worth consideration, and amd’s most recent line of “bulldozer” processors were very poorly received. now is probably as good a time as any to begin experimenting with the in-house arm designs, but it’s not time to dive into the deep end yet, our chips are not nearly mature enough to compete, and it’s not yet certain how long intel will be stuck in the mud. as well, it is widely understood that apple and intel have an exclusivity contract in exchange for advantageous pricing. any transition would take considerable time and effort, and since there are no current viable alternative to intel, the in-house chips will need to advance further, and breaching a contract with intel is too great a risk. so it makes sense to start with small deployments, to extend the timeline, stretch out to the end of the contract, and eventually release a real banger of a mac.

thus, the 2016 touch bar macbooks were born, alongside the t1 chip mentioned earlier. there are good reasons for abandoning the piece of hardware previously used for a similar purpose, the smc or system management controller. i suspect that the biggest reason was to allow early analysis of the challenges that would be faced migrating mac built- in peripherals and io to an arm-based controller, as well as exploring the manufacturing, power, and performance results of using the chips across a broad deployment, and analyzing any early failure data, then using this to patch any issues, enhance processes, and inform future designs looking towards the 2nd stage.

the former smc duties now moved to t1 includes things like

* fan speed, voltage, amperage and thermal sensor feedback data
* facetime camera and microphone io
* pmic (power management controller)
* direct communication to nand (solid state storage)
* direct communication with the touch bar
* secure enclave for touchid

the t1 chip also communicates with a number of other controllers to manage a macbook’s behavior. even though it’s not a very powerful cpu by modern standards, it’s already responsible for a large chunk of the machine’s operation. moving control of these peripherals to the t1 chip also brought about the creation of the fabled bridgeos software, a shrunken-down watchos-based system that operates fully independently of macos and the primary intel processor.

bridgeos is the first step for apple’s engineering teams to begin migrating underlying systems and services to integrate with the arm processor via bridgeos, and it allowed internal teams to more easily and safely develop and issue firmware updates. since bridgeos is based on a standard and now well-known system, it means that they can leverage existing engineering expertise to flesh out the t1’s development, rather than relying on the more arcane and specialized smc system, which operates completely differently and requires highly specific knowledge to work with. it also allows reuse of the same fabrication pipeline used for apple watch processors, and eliminated the need to have yet another ic design for the smc, coming from a separate source, to save a bit on cost.

also during this time, on the software side, “project marzipan”, today catalyst, came into existence. we'll get to this shortly.

for the most part, this stage 1 went without any major issues. there were a few firmware problems at first during the product launch, but they were quickly solved with software updates. now that engineering teams have had experience building for, manufacturing, and shipping the t1 systems, stage 2 would begin.

# stage2 (2018-present):

stage 2 encompasses the rollout of macs with the t2 coprocessor, replacing the t1. this includes a much wider lineup, including macbook pro with touch bar, starting with 2018 models, macbook air starting with 2018 models, the imac pro, the 2019 mac pro, as well as mac mini starting in 2018.

with this iteration, the more powerful t8012 processor design was used, which is a further revision of the t8010 design that powers the a10 series processors used in the iphone 7. this change provided a significant increase in computational ability and brought about the integration of even more devices into t2. in addition to the t1’s existing responsibilities, t2 now controls:

* full audio subsystem
* secure enclave for internal nand storage and encryption/decryption offload
* management of the whole system’s power and startup sequence, allowing for trusted boot (ensure boot chain-of-trust with no malicious code/rootkit/bootkit)

those last 2 points are crucial for stage 2. under this new paradigm, the vast majority of the mac is now under the control of an in-house arm processor. stage 2 also brings iphone-grade hardware security to the mac. these t2 models also incorporated a supported dfu (device firmware update, more commonly “recovery mode”), which acts similarly to the iphone dfu mode and allows restoration of the bridgeos firmware in the event of corruption (most commonly due to user-triggered power interruption during flashing).

putting more responsibility onto the t2 again allows for apple’s engineering teams to do more early failure analysis on hardware and software, monitor stability of these machines, experiment further with large-scale production and deployment of this arm platform, as well as continue to enhance the silicon for stage 3.

a few new user-visible features were added as well in this stage, such as support for the passive “hey siri” trigger, and offloading image and video transcoding to the t2 chip, which frees up the main intel processor for other applications. bridgeos was bumped to 2.0 to support all of these changes and the new chip.

on the macos software side, what was internally known as project marzipan was first demonstrated to the public. though it was originally discovered around 2017, and most likely began development and testing within later parts of stage 1, its effects could be seen in 2018 with the release of iphone apps, now running on the mac using the ios sdks: voice recorder, apple news, home, stocks, and more, with an official announcement and public release at wwdc in 2019. catalyst would come to be the name of marzipan used publicly. this sdk release allows app developers to easily port ios apps to run on macos, with minimal or no code changes, and without needing to develop separate versions for each. the end goal is to allow developers to submit a single version of an app, and allow it to work seamlessly on all apple platforms, from watch to mac. at present, ios and ipados apps are compiled for the full gamut of arm instruction sets used on those devices, while macos apps are compiled for x86\_64. the logical next step is to cross this bridge, and unify the instruction sets.

with this t2 release, the new products using it have not been quite as well received as with the t1. many users have noticed how this change contributes further towards machines with limited to no repair options outside of apple’s repair organization, as well as some general issues with bugs in the t2.

products with the t2 also no longer have the “lifeboat” connector, which was previously present on 2016 and 2017 model touch bar macbook pro. this connector allowed a certified technician to plug in a device called a cdm tool (customer data migration tool) to recover data off of a machine that was not functional. the removal of this connector limits the options for data recovery in the event of a problem, and apple has never offered any data recovery service, meaning that a irreparable failure of the t2 chip or the primary board would result in complete data loss, in part due to the strong encryption provided by the t2 chip (even if the data got off, the encryption keys were lost with the t2 chip). the t2 also brought about the linkage of component serial numbers of certain internal components, such as the solid state storage, display, and trackpad, among other components. in fact, many other controllers on the logic board are now also paired to the t2, such as the wifi and bluetooth controller, the pmic (power management controller), and several other components. this is the exact same system used on newer iphone models and is quite familiar to technicians who repair iphone logic boards. while these changes are fantastic for device security and corporate and enterprise users, allowing for a very high degree of assurance that devices will refuse to boot if tampered with in any way - even from storied supply chain attacks, or other malfeasance that can be done with physical access to a machine - it has created difficulty with consumers who more often lack the expertise or awareness to keep critical data backed up, as well as the funds to perform the necessary repairs from authorized repair providers. other issues reported that are suspected to be related to t2 are audio “cracking” or distortion on the internal speakers, and the bridgeos becoming corrupt following a firmware update resulting in a machine that can’t boot.

i believe these hiccups will be properly addressed once macos is fully integrated with the arm platform. this stage of the mac is more like a chimera of an iphone and an intel based computer. technically, it does have all of the parts of an iphone present within it, cellular radio aside, and i suspect this fusion is why these issues exist.

recently, security researchers discovered an underlying security problem present within the boot rom code of the t1 and t2 chip. due to being the same fundamental platform as earlier apple watch and iphone processors, they are vulnerable to the “checkm8” exploit (cve-2019-8900). because of how these chips operate in a mac, firmware modifications caused by use of the exploit will persist through os reinstallation and machine restarts. both the t1 and t2 chips are always on and running, though potentially in a heavily reduced power usage state, meaning the only way to clean an exploited machine is to reflash the chip, triggering a restart, or to fully exhaust or physically disconnect the battery to flush its memory. fortunately, this exploit cannot be done remotely and requires physical access to the mac for an extended duration, as well as a second mac to perform the change, so the majority of users are relatively safe. as well, with a very limited execution environment and access to the primary system only through a “mailbox” protocol, the utility of exploiting these chips is extremely limited. at present, there is no known malware that has used this exploit. the proper fix will come with the next hardware revision, and is considered a low priority due to the lack of practical usage of running malicious code on the coprocessor.

at the time of writing, all current apple computers have a t2 chip present, with the exception of the 2019 imac lineup. this will change very soon with the expected release of the 2020 imac lineup at wwdc, which will incorporate a t2 coprocessor as well.

note: from here on, this turns entirely into speculation based on info gathered from a variety of disparate sources.

right now, we are in the final steps of stage 2. there are strong signs that an a macbook (12”) with an arm main processor will be announced this year at wwdc (“one more thing...”), at a fall 2020 event, q1 2021 event, or wwdc 2021. based on the lack of a more concrete answer, wwdc2020 will likely not see it, but i am open to being wrong here.

# stage3 (present/2021 - 2022/2023):

stage 3 involves the first version of at least one fully arm-powered mac into apple’s computer lineup.

i expect this will come in the form of the previously-retired 12” macbook. there are rumors that apple is still working internally to perfect the infamous butterfly keyboard, and there are also signs that apple is developing an a14x based processors with 8-12 cores designed specifically for use as the primary processor in a mac. it makes sense that this model could see the return of the butterfly keyboard, considering how thin and light it is intended to be, and using an a14x processor would make it will be a very capable, very portable machine, and should give customers a good taste of what is to come.

personally, i am excited to test the new 12"" “armbook”. i do miss my own original 12"", even with all the cpu failure issues those older models had. it was a lovely form factor for me.

it's still not entirely known whether the physical design of these will change from the retired version, exactly how many cores it will have, the port configuration, etc. i have also heard rumors about the 12” model possibly supporting 5g cellular connectivity natively thanks to the a14 series processor. all of this will most likely be confirmed soon enough.

this 12” model will be the perfect stepping stone for stage 3, since apple’s arm processors are not yet a full-on replacement for intel’s full processor lineup, especially at the high end, in products such as the upcoming 2020 imac, imac pro, 16” macbook pro, and the 2019 mac pro.

performance of apple’s arm platform compared to intel has been a big point of contention over the last couple years, primarily due to the lack of data representative of real-world desktop usage scenarios. the ipad pro and other models with apple’s highest-end silicon still lack the ability to execute a lot of high end professional applications, so data about anything more than video editing and photo editing tasks benchmarks quickly becomes meaningless. while there are completely synthetic benchmarks like geekbench, antutu, and others, to try and bridge the gap, they are very far from being accurate or representative of the real real world performance in many instances. even though the apple arm processors are incredibly powerful, and i do give constant praise to their silicon design teams, there still just isn’t enough data to show how they will perform for real-world desktop usage scenarios, and synthetic benchmarks are like standardized testing: they only show how good a platform is at running the synthetic benchmark. this type of benchmark stresses only very specific parts of each chip at a time, rather than how well it does a general task, and then boil down the complexity and nuances of each chip into a single numeric score, which is not a remotely accurate way of representing processors with vastly different capabilities and designs. it would be like gauging how well a person performs a manual labor task based on averaging only the speed of every individual muscle in the body, regardless of if, or how much, each is used. a specific group of muscles being stronger or weaker than others could wildly skew the final result, and grossly misrepresent performance of the person as a whole. real world program performance will be the key in determining the success and future of this transition, and it will have to be great on this 12"" model, but not just in a limited set of tasks, it will have to be great at \*everything\*. it is intended to be the first horseman of the apocalypse for the intel mac, and it better behave like one. consumers have been expecting this, especially after 15 years of intel processors, the continued advancement of apple’s processors, and the decline of intel’s market lead.

the point of this “demonstration” model is to ease both users and developers into the desktop arm ecosystem slowly. much like how the iphone x paved the way for faceid-enabled iphones, this 12"" model will pave the way towards arm mac systems. some power-user type consumers may complain at first, depending on the software compatibility story, then realize it works just fine since the majority of the computer users today do not do many tasks that can’t be accomplished on an ipad or lower end computer. apple needs to gain the public’s trust for basic tasks first, before they will be able to break into the market of users performing more hardcore or “pro” tasks. this early model will probably not be targeted at these high-end professionals, which will allow apple to begin to gather early information about the stability and performance of this model, day to day usability, developmental issues that need to be addressed, hardware failure analysis, etc. all of this information is crucial to stage 4, or possibly later parts of stage 3.

the 2 biggest concerns most people have with the architecture change is app support and bootcamp.

any apps released through the mac app store will not be a problem. because app store apps are submitted as llvm ir (“bitcode”), the system can automatically download versions compiled and optimized for arm platforms, similar to how app thinning on ios works. for apps distributed outside the app store, thing might be more tricky. there are a few ways this could go:

* developer will need to build both x86\_64 and arm version of their app - app bundles have supported multiple-architecture binaries since the dawn of os x and the powerpc transition
* move to apps being distributed in an architecture-independent manner, as they are on the app store. there is some software changes that are suggestive of this, such as the new architecture in dyld3.
* an x86\_64 instruction decoder in silicon - very unlikely due to the significant overhead this would create in the silicon design, and potential licensing issues. (arm, being a risc, “reduced instruction set”, has very few instructions; x86\_64 has thousands)
* server-side ahead-of-time transpilation (converting x86 code to equivalent arm code) using notarization submissions - apple certainly has the compiler chops in the llvm team to do something like this
* outright emulation, similar to the approach that was taken in arm releases of windows, but received extremely poorly (limited to 32-bit apps, and very very slow)there could be other solutions in the works to fix this but i am not aware of any. this is just me speculating about some of the possibilities.

as for bootcamp, while arm-compatible versions of windows do exist and are in development, they come with their own similar set of app support problems. microsoft has experimented with emulating x86\_64 on their arm-based surface products, and some other oems have created their own windows-powered arm laptops, but with very little success. performance is a problem across the board, with other arm silicon not being anywhere near as advanced, and with the majority of apps in the windows ecosystem that were not developed in-house at microsoft running terribly due to the x86\_64 emulation software. if bootcamp does come to the early arm macbook, it more than likely will run like very poorly for anything other than windows uwp apps. there is a high chance it will be abandoned entirely until windows becomes much more friendly to the architecture.

i believe this will also be a very crucial turning point for the macbook lineup as a whole. at present, the ipad pro paired with the magic keyboard is, in many ways, nearly identical to a laptop, with the biggest difference being the system software itself. while apple executives have outright denied plans of merging the ipad and macbook line, that could very well just be a marketing stance, shutting the down rumors in anticipation of a well-executed surprise. i think that apple might at least re-examine the possibility of merging macs and ipads in some capacity, but whether they proceed or not could be driven by consumer reaction to both products. do they prefer the feel and usability of macos on arm, and like the separation of both products? is there success across the industry of the arm platform, both at the lower and higher end of the market? do users see that ipados and macos are just 2 halves of the same coin? should there be a middle ground, and a new type of product similar to the surface book, but running macos? should macs and ipads run a completely uniform os? will ipados ever see exposed the same sort of unix-based tools for it administrators and software developers that macos has present? these are all very real questions that will pop up in the near future.

the line between stage 3 and stage 4 will be blurry, and will depend on how apple wishes to address different problems going forward, and what the reactions look like. it is very possible that only 12” will be released at first, or a handful more lower end model laptop and desktop products could be released, with high performance macs following in stage 4, or perhaps everything but enterprise products like mac pro will be switched fully. only time will tell.

# stage 4 (the end goal):

congratulations, you’re made it to the end of my ted talk. we are now well into the 2020s and covid-19 part 4 is casually catching up to the 5g = virus crowd. all macs have transitioned fully to arm. imac, macbooks pro and otherwise, mac pro, mac mini, everything. the future is fully apple from top to bottom, and vertical integration leading to market dominance continues. many other oem have begun to follow in this path to some extent, creating more demand for a similar class of silicon from other firms.

the remainder here is pure speculation with a dash of wishful thinking. there are still a lot of things that are entirely unclear. the only concrete thing is that stage 4 will happen when everything is running apple’s in- house processors.

by this point, consumers will be quite familiar with the arm macs existing, and developers have had have enough time to transition apps fully over to the newly unified system. any performance, battery life, or app support concerns will not be an issue at this point.

there are no more details here, it’s the end of the road, but we are left with a number of questions.

it is unclear if apple will stick to amd's gpus or whether they will instead opt to use their in-house graphics solutions that have been used since the a11 series of processors.

how thunderbolt support on these models of mac will be achieved is unknown. while intel has made it openly available for use, and there are plans to have usb and thunderbolt combined in a single standard, it’s still unclear how it will play along with apple processors. presently, iphones do support connecting devices via pci express to the processor, but it has only been used for iphone and ipad storage. the current apple processors simply lack the number of lanes required for even the lowest end macbook pro. this is an issue that would need to be addressed in order to ship a full desktop-grade platform.

there is also the question of upgradability for desktop models, and if and how there will be a replaceable, socketed version of these processors. will standard desktop and laptop memory modules play nicely with these arm processors? will they drop standard memory across the board, in favor of soldered options, or continue to support user-configurable memory on some models? will my 2023 mac pro play nicely with a standard pci express device that i buy off the shelf? will we see a return of “mac edition” pci devices?

there are still a lot of unknowns, and guessing any further in advance is too difficult. the only thing that is certain, however, is that apple processors coming to mac is very much within arm’s reach.",https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/h7l6d7/the_next_processor_change_is_within_arms_reach/,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/h7l6d7/the_next_processor_change_is_within_arms_reach/,h7l6d7,531,the next processor change is within arms reach.,0,"the next processor change is within arms reach. as you may have seen, i sent the following tweet: “the apple arm macbook future is coming, maybe sooner than people expect” [https://twitter.com/choco\_bit/status/1266200305009676289?s=20](https://twitter.com/choco_bit/status/1266200305009676289?s=20)

today, i would like to further elaborate on that.

*tl;dr*  
*apple will be moving to arm based macs in what i believe are 4 stages, starting around 2015 and ending around 2023-2025: release of t1 chip macbooks, release of t2 chip macbooks, release of at least one lower end model arm macbook, and transitioning full lineup to arm. reasons for each are below.*

apple is very likely going to switch to switch their cpu platform to their in-house silicon designs with an arm architecture. this understanding is a fairly common amongst various apple insiders. here is my personal take on how this switch will happen and be presented to the consumer.

the first question would likely be “why would apple do this again?”. throughout their history, apple has already made two other storied cpu architecture switches - first from the motorola 68k to powerpc in the early 90s, then from powerpc to intel in the mid 2000s. why make yet another? here are the leading reasons:

* intel  has, in recent years, been making significant losses both in reputation and in actual product value, as well as velocity of product development, breaking their bi-yearly “tick tock” cycle for the first time in decades. most recently, they have fallen well behind amd’s processor lines in cost to performance ratio, cpu core count, core design (monolithic design vs “chiplet”), power consumption to performance, silicon supply (intel with significant manufacturing process and yield issues), and on-silicon security features. while intel still wins out in certain enterprise and datacenter applications, as well as having a much better reputation for reliability and qa (amd having shipped numerous chips with a broken random- number generator that prevented even booting some mainstream operating system), the number of such applications slowly dwindles with each new release from amd, and as confidence among decisionmakers in enterprise increases. in the public consciousness, intel is quickly becoming a point of ridicule against apple’s mac lineup, rather than a badge of honor.
* by moving to their own designs, apple will be free from intel’s release schedule, which have recently been unpredictable and faced with routine delays due to poor manufacturing yields. apple will be able to update their mac lineup on their own timeline, rather than being forced to delay products based on intel’s ability to meet the release window. this also allows them to leverage relationships with other silicon fabricators to source chips, rather than relying on intel ’s continued “iteration” that’s leading to a “14nm++++++++++” process, or the continued lack of product diversity with the 10nm process. apple will also be free to innovate in the design of the silicon platform, rather than being limited by intel’s design choices. by having full control of the manufacturing and development cycle, apple can bring even more in-house optimization to the macos, as they have been for ios and ipados over the years.
* using an arm architecture on the macs allows for a more unified apple ecosystem, rather than having separate mac and ios-based products. the only distinction will be the device form factor and performance characteristics.
* the x86\_64 architecture is very old and inefficient, using older methodologies for processor design (cisc vs arm’s risc), and the instruction set continues to require support in silicon for emulating 1980s-vintage 16-bit modes, as well as ineffectual and archaic memory addressing modes (segmentation, etc.) the x86\_64 architecture is like a city, built atop a much older city, built atop a yet older city, but every layer is built with nyc infrastructure levels of complexity that suited its time and no further.
* over the last 10 years, apple has shown that they can consistently produce impressive silicon designs, often leading the market in performance and capability, and apple has been aggressively acquiring silicon design talent.

a common refrain heard on the internet is the suggestion that apple should switch to using cpus made by amd, and while this has been considered internally, it will most likely not be chosen as the path forward, even for their megalithic giants like the mac pro. even though amd would mitigate intel’s current set of problems, it does nothing to help the issue of the x86\_64 architecture’s problems and inefficiencies, on top of jumping to a platform that doesn’t have a decade of proven support behind it. why spend a lot of effort re-designing and re- optimizing for amd’s platform when you can just put that effort into your own, and continue the vertical integration apple is well-known for?

i believe that the internal development for the arm transition started around 2015/2016 and is considered to be happening in 4 distinct stages. these are not all information from apple insiders; some of these these are my own interpretation based off of information gathered from supply-chain sources, examination of macbook schematics, and other indicators from apple.

# stage1 (from 2014/2015 to 2017):

the rollout of computers with apple’s t1 chip as a coprocessor. this chip is very similar to apple’s t8002 chip design, which was used for the apple watch series 1 and series 2. the t1 is primarily present on the first touchid enabled macs, 2016 and 2017 model year macbook pros.

considering the amount of time required to design and validate a processor, this stage most likely started around 2014 or 2015, with early experimentation to see whether an entirely new chip design would be required, or if would be sufficient to repurpose something in the existing lineup. as we can see, the general purpose arm processors aren’t a one- trick pony.

to get a sense of the decision making at the time, let’s look back a bit. the year is 2016, and we're witnessing the beginning of stagnation of intel processor lineup. there is not a lot to look forward to other than another “+” being added to the 14nm fabrication process. the macbook pro has used the same design for many years now, and its age is starting to show. moving to amd is still very questionable, as they’ve historically not been able to match intel’s performance or functionality, especially at the high end, and since the “ryzen” lineup is still unreleased, there is absolutely no benchmarks or other data to show they are worth consideration, and amd’s most recent line of “bulldozer” processors were very poorly received. now is probably as good a time as any to begin experimenting with the in-house arm designs, but it’s not time to dive into the deep end yet, our chips are not nearly mature enough to compete, and it’s not yet certain how long intel will be stuck in the mud. as well, it is widely understood that apple and intel have an exclusivity contract in exchange for advantageous pricing. any transition would take considerable time and effort, and since there are no current viable alternative to intel, the in-house chips will need to advance further, and breaching a contract with intel is too great a risk. so it makes sense to start with small deployments, to extend the timeline, stretch out to the end of the contract, and eventually release a real banger of a mac.

thus, the 2016 touch bar macbooks were born, alongside the t1 chip mentioned earlier. there are good reasons for abandoning the piece of hardware previously used for a similar purpose, the smc or system management controller. i suspect that the biggest reason was to allow early analysis of the challenges that would be faced migrating mac built- in peripherals and io to an arm-based controller, as well as exploring the manufacturing, power, and performance results of using the chips across a broad deployment, and analyzing any early failure data, then using this to patch any issues, enhance processes, and inform future designs looking towards the 2nd stage.

the former smc duties now moved to t1 includes things like

* fan speed, voltage, amperage and thermal sensor feedback data
* facetime camera and microphone io
* pmic (power management controller)
* direct communication to nand (solid state storage)
* direct communication with the touch bar
* secure enclave for touchid

the t1 chip also communicates with a number of other controllers to manage a macbook’s behavior. even though it’s not a very powerful cpu by modern standards, it’s already responsible for a large chunk of the machine’s operation. moving control of these peripherals to the t1 chip also brought about the creation of the fabled bridgeos software, a shrunken-down watchos-based system that operates fully independently of macos and the primary intel processor.

bridgeos is the first step for apple’s engineering teams to begin migrating underlying systems and services to integrate with the arm processor via bridgeos, and it allowed internal teams to more easily and safely develop and issue firmware updates. since bridgeos is based on a standard and now well-known system, it means that they can leverage existing engineering expertise to flesh out the t1’s development, rather than relying on the more arcane and specialized smc system, which operates completely differently and requires highly specific knowledge to work with. it also allows reuse of the same fabrication pipeline used for apple watch processors, and eliminated the need to have yet another ic design for the smc, coming from a separate source, to save a bit on cost.

also during this time, on the software side, “project marzipan”, today catalyst, came into existence. we'll get to this shortly.

for the most part, this stage 1 went without any major issues. there were a few firmware problems at first during the product launch, but they were quickly solved with software updates. now that engineering teams have had experience building for, manufacturing, and shipping the t1 systems, stage 2 would begin.

# stage2 (2018-present):

stage 2 encompasses the rollout of macs with the t2 coprocessor, replacing the t1. this includes a much wider lineup, including macbook pro with touch bar, starting with 2018 models, macbook air starting with 2018 models, the imac pro, the 2019 mac pro, as well as mac mini starting in 2018.

with this iteration, the more powerful t8012 processor design was used, which is a further revision of the t8010 design that powers the a10 series processors used in the iphone 7. this change provided a significant increase in computational ability and brought about the integration of even more devices into t2. in addition to the t1’s existing responsibilities, t2 now controls:

* full audio subsystem
* secure enclave for internal nand storage and encryption/decryption offload
* management of the whole system’s power and startup sequence, allowing for trusted boot (ensure boot chain-of-trust with no malicious code/rootkit/bootkit)

those last 2 points are crucial for stage 2. under this new paradigm, the vast majority of the mac is now under the control of an in-house arm processor. stage 2 also brings iphone-grade hardware security to the mac. these t2 models also incorporated a supported dfu (device firmware update, more commonly “recovery mode”), which acts similarly to the iphone dfu mode and allows restoration of the bridgeos firmware in the event of corruption (most commonly due to user-triggered power interruption during flashing).

putting more responsibility onto the t2 again allows for apple’s engineering teams to do more early failure analysis on hardware and software, monitor stability of these machines, experiment further with large-scale production and deployment of this arm platform, as well as continue to enhance the silicon for stage 3.

a few new user-visible features were added as well in this stage, such as support for the passive “hey siri” trigger, and offloading image and video transcoding to the t2 chip, which frees up the main intel processor for other applications. bridgeos was bumped to 2.0 to support all of these changes and the new chip.

on the macos software side, what was internally known as project marzipan was first demonstrated to the public. though it was originally discovered around 2017, and most likely began development and testing within later parts of stage 1, its effects could be seen in 2018 with the release of iphone apps, now running on the mac using the ios sdks: voice recorder, apple news, home, stocks, and more, with an official announcement and public release at wwdc in 2019. catalyst would come to be the name of marzipan used publicly. this sdk release allows app developers to easily port ios apps to run on macos, with minimal or no code changes, and without needing to develop separate versions for each. the end goal is to allow developers to submit a single version of an app, and allow it to work seamlessly on all apple platforms, from watch to mac. at present, ios and ipados apps are compiled for the full gamut of arm instruction sets used on those devices, while macos apps are compiled for x86\_64. the logical next step is to cross this bridge, and unify the instruction sets.

with this t2 release, the new products using it have not been quite as well received as with the t1. many users have noticed how this change contributes further towards machines with limited to no repair options outside of apple’s repair organization, as well as some general issues with bugs in the t2.

products with the t2 also no longer have the “lifeboat” connector, which was previously present on 2016 and 2017 model touch bar macbook pro. this connector allowed a certified technician to plug in a device called a cdm tool (customer data migration tool) to recover data off of a machine that was not functional. the removal of this connector limits the options for data recovery in the event of a problem, and apple has never offered any data recovery service, meaning that a irreparable failure of the t2 chip or the primary board would result in complete data loss, in part due to the strong encryption provided by the t2 chip (even if the data got off, the encryption keys were lost with the t2 chip). the t2 also brought about the linkage of component serial numbers of certain internal components, such as the solid state storage, display, and trackpad, among other components. in fact, many other controllers on the logic board are now also paired to the t2, such as the wifi and bluetooth controller, the pmic (power management controller), and several other components. this is the exact same system used on newer iphone models and is quite familiar to technicians who repair iphone logic boards. while these changes are fantastic for device security and corporate and enterprise users, allowing for a very high degree of assurance that devices will refuse to boot if tampered with in any way - even from storied supply chain attacks, or other malfeasance that can be done with physical access to a machine - it has created difficulty with consumers who more often lack the expertise or awareness to keep critical data backed up, as well as the funds to perform the necessary repairs from authorized repair providers. other issues reported that are suspected to be related to t2 are audio “cracking” or distortion on the internal speakers, and the bridgeos becoming corrupt following a firmware update resulting in a machine that can’t boot.

i believe these hiccups will be properly addressed once macos is fully integrated with the arm platform. this stage of the mac is more like a chimera of an iphone and an intel based computer. technically, it does have all of the parts of an iphone present within it, cellular radio aside, and i suspect this fusion is why these issues exist.

recently, security researchers discovered an underlying security problem present within the boot rom code of the t1 and t2 chip. due to being the same fundamental platform as earlier apple watch and iphone processors, they are vulnerable to the “checkm8” exploit (cve-2019-8900). because of how these chips operate in a mac, firmware modifications caused by use of the exploit will persist through os reinstallation and machine restarts. both the t1 and t2 chips are always on and running, though potentially in a heavily reduced power usage state, meaning the only way to clean an exploited machine is to reflash the chip, triggering a restart, or to fully exhaust or physically disconnect the battery to flush its memory. fortunately, this exploit cannot be done remotely and requires physical access to the mac for an extended duration, as well as a second mac to perform the change, so the majority of users are relatively safe. as well, with a very limited execution environment and access to the primary system only through a “mailbox” protocol, the utility of exploiting these chips is extremely limited. at present, there is no known malware that has used this exploit. the proper fix will come with the next hardware revision, and is considered a low priority due to the lack of practical usage of running malicious code on the coprocessor.

at the time of writing, all current apple computers have a t2 chip present, with the exception of the 2019 imac lineup. this will change very soon with the expected release of the 2020 imac lineup at wwdc, which will incorporate a t2 coprocessor as well.

note: from here on, this turns entirely into speculation based on info gathered from a variety of disparate sources.

right now, we are in the final steps of stage 2. there are strong signs that an a macbook (12”) with an arm main processor will be announced this year at wwdc (“one more thing...”), at a fall 2020 event, q1 2021 event, or wwdc 2021. based on the lack of a more concrete answer, wwdc2020 will likely not see it, but i am open to being wrong here.

# stage3 (present/2021 - 2022/2023):

stage 3 involves the first version of at least one fully arm-powered mac into apple’s computer lineup.

i expect this will come in the form of the previously-retired 12” macbook. there are rumors that apple is still working internally to perfect the infamous butterfly keyboard, and there are also signs that apple is developing an a14x based processors with 8-12 cores designed specifically for use as the primary processor in a mac. it makes sense that this model could see the return of the butterfly keyboard, considering how thin and light it is intended to be, and using an a14x processor would make it will be a very capable, very portable machine, and should give customers a good taste of what is to come.

personally, i am excited to test the new 12"" “armbook”. i do miss my own original 12"", even with all the cpu failure issues those older models had. it was a lovely form factor for me.

it's still not entirely known whether the physical design of these will change from the retired version, exactly how many cores it will have, the port configuration, etc. i have also heard rumors about the 12” model possibly supporting 5g cellular connectivity natively thanks to the a14 series processor. all of this will most likely be confirmed soon enough.

this 12” model will be the perfect stepping stone for stage 3, since apple’s arm processors are not yet a full-on replacement for intel’s full processor lineup, especially at the high end, in products such as the upcoming 2020 imac, imac pro, 16” macbook pro, and the 2019 mac pro.

performance of apple’s arm platform compared to intel has been a big point of contention over the last couple years, primarily due to the lack of data representative of real-world desktop usage scenarios. the ipad pro and other models with apple’s highest-end silicon still lack the ability to execute a lot of high end professional applications, so data about anything more than video editing and photo editing tasks benchmarks quickly becomes meaningless. while there are completely synthetic benchmarks like geekbench, antutu, and others, to try and bridge the gap, they are very far from being accurate or representative of the real real world performance in many instances. even though the apple arm processors are incredibly powerful, and i do give constant praise to their silicon design teams, there still just isn’t enough data to show how they will perform for real-world desktop usage scenarios, and synthetic benchmarks are like standardized testing: they only show how good a platform is at running the synthetic benchmark. this type of benchmark stresses only very specific parts of each chip at a time, rather than how well it does a general task, and then boil down the complexity and nuances of each chip into a single numeric score, which is not a remotely accurate way of representing processors with vastly different capabilities and designs. it would be like gauging how well a person performs a manual labor task based on averaging only the speed of every individual muscle in the body, regardless of if, or how much, each is used. a specific group of muscles being stronger or weaker than others could wildly skew the final result, and grossly misrepresent performance of the person as a whole. real world program performance will be the key in determining the success and future of this transition, and it will have to be great on this 12"" model, but not just in a limited set of tasks, it will have to be great at \*everything\*. it is intended to be the first horseman of the apocalypse for the intel mac, and it better behave like one. consumers have been expecting this, especially after 15 years of intel processors, the continued advancement of apple’s processors, and the decline of intel’s market lead.

the point of this “demonstration” model is to ease both users and developers into the desktop arm ecosystem slowly. much like how the iphone x paved the way for faceid-enabled iphones, this 12"" model will pave the way towards arm mac systems. some power-user type consumers may complain at first, depending on the software compatibility story, then realize it works just fine since the majority of the computer users today do not do many tasks that can’t be accomplished on an ipad or lower end computer. apple needs to gain the public’s trust for basic tasks first, before they will be able to break into the market of users performing more hardcore or “pro” tasks. this early model will probably not be targeted at these high-end professionals, which will allow apple to begin to gather early information about the stability and performance of this model, day to day usability, developmental issues that need to be addressed, hardware failure analysis, etc. all of this information is crucial to stage 4, or possibly later parts of stage 3.

the 2 biggest concerns most people have with the architecture change is app support and bootcamp.

any apps released through the mac app store will not be a problem. because app store apps are submitted as llvm ir (“bitcode”), the system can automatically download versions compiled and optimized for arm platforms, similar to how app thinning on ios works. for apps distributed outside the app store, thing might be more tricky. there are a few ways this could go:

* developer will need to build both x86\_64 and arm version of their app - app bundles have supported multiple-architecture binaries since the dawn of os x and the powerpc transition
* move to apps being distributed in an architecture-independent manner, as they are on the app store. there is some software changes that are suggestive of this, such as the new architecture in dyld3.
* an x86\_64 instruction decoder in silicon - very unlikely due to the significant overhead this would create in the silicon design, and potential licensing issues. (arm, being a risc, “reduced instruction set”, has very few instructions; x86\_64 has thousands)
* server-side ahead-of-time transpilation (converting x86 code to equivalent arm code) using notarization submissions - apple certainly has the compiler chops in the llvm team to do something like this
* outright emulation, similar to the approach that was taken in arm releases of windows, but received extremely poorly (limited to 32-bit apps, and very very slow)there could be other solutions in the works to fix this but i am not aware of any. this is just me speculating about some of the possibilities.

as for bootcamp, while arm-compatible versions of windows do exist and are in development, they come with their own similar set of app support problems. microsoft has experimented with emulating x86\_64 on their arm-based surface products, and some other oems have created their own windows-powered arm laptops, but with very little success. performance is a problem across the board, with other arm silicon not being anywhere near as advanced, and with the majority of apps in the windows ecosystem that were not developed in-house at microsoft running terribly due to the x86\_64 emulation software. if bootcamp does come to the early arm macbook, it more than likely will run like very poorly for anything other than windows uwp apps. there is a high chance it will be abandoned entirely until windows becomes much more friendly to the architecture.

i believe this will also be a very crucial turning point for the macbook lineup as a whole. at present, the ipad pro paired with the magic keyboard is, in many ways, nearly identical to a laptop, with the biggest difference being the system software itself. while apple executives have outright denied plans of merging the ipad and macbook line, that could very well just be a marketing stance, shutting the down rumors in anticipation of a well-executed surprise. i think that apple might at least re-examine the possibility of merging macs and ipads in some capacity, but whether they proceed or not could be driven by consumer reaction to both products. do they prefer the feel and usability of macos on arm, and like the separation of both products? is there success across the industry of the arm platform, both at the lower and higher end of the market? do users see that ipados and macos are just 2 halves of the same coin? should there be a middle ground, and a new type of product similar to the surface book, but running macos? should macs and ipads run a completely uniform os? will ipados ever see exposed the same sort of unix-based tools for it administrators and software developers that macos has present? these are all very real questions that will pop up in the near future.

the line between stage 3 and stage 4 will be blurry, and will depend on how apple wishes to address different problems going forward, and what the reactions look like. it is very possible that only 12” will be released at first, or a handful more lower end model laptop and desktop products could be released, with high performance macs following in stage 4, or perhaps everything but enterprise products like mac pro will be switched fully. only time will tell.

# stage 4 (the end goal):

congratulations, you’re made it to the end of my ted talk. we are now well into the 2020s and covid-19 part 4 is casually catching up to the 5g = virus crowd. all macs have transitioned fully to arm. imac, macbooks pro and otherwise, mac pro, mac mini, everything. the future is fully apple from top to bottom, and vertical integration leading to market dominance continues. many other oem have begun to follow in this path to some extent, creating more demand for a similar class of silicon from other firms.

the remainder here is pure speculation with a dash of wishful thinking. there are still a lot of things that are entirely unclear. the only concrete thing is that stage 4 will happen when everything is running apple’s in- house processors.

by this point, consumers will be quite familiar with the arm macs existing, and developers have had have enough time to transition apps fully over to the newly unified system. any performance, battery life, or app support concerns will not be an issue at this point.

there are no more details here, it’s the end of the road, but we are left with a number of questions.

it is unclear if apple will stick to amd's gpus or whether they will instead opt to use their in-house graphics solutions that have been used since the a11 series of processors.

how thunderbolt support on these models of mac will be achieved is unknown. while intel has made it openly available for use, and there are plans to have usb and thunderbolt combined in a single standard, it’s still unclear how it will play along with apple processors. presently, iphones do support connecting devices via pci express to the processor, but it has only been used for iphone and ipad storage. the current apple processors simply lack the number of lanes required for even the lowest end macbook pro. this is an issue that would need to be addressed in order to ship a full desktop-grade platform.

there is also the question of upgradability for desktop models, and if and how there will be a replaceable, socketed version of these processors. will standard desktop and laptop memory modules play nicely with these arm processors? will they drop standard memory across the board, in favor of soldered options, or continue to support user-configurable memory on some models? will my 2023 mac pro play nicely with a standard pci express device that i buy off the shelf? will we see a return of “mac edition” pci devices?

there are still a lot of unknowns, and guessing any further in advance is too difficult. the only thing that is certain, however, is that apple processors coming to mac is very much within arm’s reach."
7,57,1587073567,1,"in february, i decided to finally upgrade my iphone 5 to an iphone 11. it was a long needed upgrade and i am incredibly happy with my phone but since the last time i walked into apple before purchasing the 11, i feel like their customer service has really gone down. sorry if this isn’t allowed by the way, i just need a place to vent this frustration.

when i walked in, i told the specialist that i would like to purchase the iphone 11, white, 128gb. i also asked to check if i get any discounts for working in a hospital. they checked and gave me like $17 off. awesome! when we were setting up the phone, it would not connect to my service. i was told some phones have antenna issues. so we had to return the phone and get a new one. this happened 3 times. i realized a few things during this though. the specialist activated a total of 4 sim cards to make sure it wasn’t a sim issue as well so i would be charged 4 upgrade fees. also she forgot to ring up my employee discount on the final working phone. i mentioned it to her and she told me she would call to get the upgrade fees waived and also asked me if i’m okay to get the discount on a gift card. i told her it’s fine but asked if i can get an itunes gift card instead (i didn’t care if it was $10 or $15 gift card, i figured i won’t be using a $17 apple store gift card anytime). she told me the apple store gift card can be used in the app store. i didn’t know at the time it couldn’t so i just took it, why not?

well here’s where everything gets messy. i get my carrier bill and saw i was being charged 4 upgrade fees. i figured maybe she forgot to call so i called my carrier to get things sorted. after an hour on the phone, my carrier said they could only waive 1 upgrade fee. of course this was irritating because i only upgraded 1 phone number... after back and forth calls and being on hold for a few more hours, i gave up and paid the 3 upgrade fees. was irritated but i just wanted to move on.

now to last night, i saw lumafusion went on sale and i’ve been wanting a video editing app for my ipad so i decided to buy it. i remembered of my gift card and tried to redeem it only to find out i can’t. i gave apple support a call earlier today to try to find out what’s going on. i spent 2 and a half hours (3 if you count me on hold for an hour) on the phone with them only for them to tell me no and that i can try speaking to another department. i think the most frustrating part of this was that the specialist had me send pictures of the gift card, then told me i had to write the balance on the gift card, then told me to send a copy of the receipt with the gift card, then told me she couldn’t open pdfs for some reason and take a screenshot, then she told me she can open pdfs and if i could send a scan of both the gift card and receipt. throughout the call, she kept telling me that her system needs to be updated and might have to call me back (i’m not sure how true this was because she never ended up doing so). after all this, she told me she can’t do it because the system doesn’t allow a purchase of an itunes gift card with an apple store gift card. why couldn’t she tell me that in the very beginning! i asked for her supervisor who told me the same thing and i told her to please inform your staff to tell the customer first before wasting 3 hours of doing who knows what.

welp, i’m frustrated, got a $17 apple store gift card that i really don’t know what to do with since mostly everything in the apple store is more than $17. any ideas? i remember when i picked up my iphone 5 years ago, it was much easier than all this. when i picked up the ipad pro (first generation) years ago, it was still easier. it’s so frustrating that i had to pay 3 upgrade fees because of broken antennas and that i wasted 3 hours of my 1 day off from work to deal with this :t

9,63,1584354091,1,"i just had one of the worst customer service experiences i have ever had the displeasure of going through. not sure what my options are now, grateful for any views. i am being as honest as i can about my attitude going through this, as i don't want to give the impression that i was an angel throughout the whole process, but i will say that as it went on, my frustration with the experience led me to getting more snappy with the staff that i spoke to. 


the story begins here. apologies for the long wall of text. 


i purchased an ipad for my partner on 11 nov 2019. it came with the free one year apple tv+ subscription. i did not realise this had to be activated within 3 months of purchase, and i essentially forgot about it. i didn't receive the reminders because the ipad was registered under my partner's name so the reminders went to her email. i accept that up to here, this is all my fault. 


i realised in early march 2020 that the deadline to register for the free apple tv+ subscription had passed. the deadline would have been some time in early feb (not sure if its 3 months or 90 days, i've been told a number of different things by the various customer support people i spoke to), so i missed it by a few weeks to a month. 


i decided to contact apple support. this was on 7 march. i did so via the apple support chat link, so it was a live chat with one of the cs staff. i was, at this point, very apologetic. i said i knew it was my fault that i had missed the deadline to sign up, but since it was only a few weeks, was there something that could be done? i admit that at this point, i thought it would be a very routine encounter - someone would admonish me for missing the deadline, activate the one year subscription, and that would be that. this was not the case. 


the cs rep (rep #1) i spoke to said he would do his best to assist. he asked when i had purchased the device, and for proof of purchase. i gave him the date, but said that i was not able to find the receipt. i said that the device had been registered on 11 nov 2019, which was the day i had bought the ipad - wouldn't that be sufficient? he said no, unfortunately there was nothing he could do until i found the physical receipt, and that i had to find it before he could assist me. he suggested contacting the store that i'd purchased the device from to ask for a copy. he gave a case number so i could follow up once i found the receipt, and i said i didn't really see how it made a difference, but ok. the conversation ended there. i don't have a log of the conversation with rep #1, but my understanding at this point was that if i found the receipt, there wouldn't be any issue and he'd grant an extension and i receive my one year. so i went to search for the receipt for quite some time, couldn't find it, and decided to give up. 


the next week - 16 march - i had a free day, so i decided to follow his advice and go to the shop which i had bought the ipad from. thankfully, they managed to locate my purchase and printed out another copy of the receipt for me. i then contacted customer support again using the follow-up case number that rep #1 gave me. i was put in touch with rep #2. i provided him the receipt. 


after going through the previous conversation with rep #1, rep #2 told me that there was nothing he could do - there was no policy for extending the 3 month sign-up period. i said i was surprised, because my understanding from rep #1 was that he could assist once i found the receipt. based on that, i had searched my entire house, and then made a special trip to the store to get the receipt. rep #2 said there was nothing he could do and apologised. now i was starting to get frustrated, because this was entirely different from what rep #1 had told me, and if so, i wouldn't have spent time to go get the receipt. after further back and forth, he said the best he could do was to offer 3 months free trial. i asked if he would be able to reach some middle ground, and activate the one year from 11 nov 2019 - so i wouldn't be getting any extra time from my own mistake. he said there was nothing, and the best he could offer was 3 months. 


to add on to my current annoyance, rep #2 was, honestly, a bit of a mess and kept making mistakes. first, halfway through the conversation, he apologised for not being to accede to my request for signing up for ""applecare"". this was after 30 minutes talking to him about apple tv+. he quickly apologised for the typo after i asked if there was a misunderstanding. then, after going off to speak to a supervisor, he came back and said - i have checked and you ""are eligible for the one year"". i was of course elated - but then the next part of his message made clear it was a typo, and he actually meant i was not eligible. i was honestly very annoyed at this point. i accept that people make typos. but these were obviously wrong and made me feel as if he was not taking the issue seriously. i asked if i could speak to someone else. i admit that i started getting quite cross at this point and it was apparent from my messages that i was annoyed. 


he assured me that 3 months was the maximum, but referred me to his supervisor, rep #3. long story short, rep #3 said he could only agree to 3 months, and that no one else would be able to offer anything better. i said fine, is there anyone else i can speak to? he gave me a helpline number to call. this seemed odd, as it was a general helpline, so i asked who that line would go to and how they could assist? he essentially said - no they won't be able to assist, but since you wanted to speak to someone else, i gave you the number. this really annoyed me. 


i asked for an alternative feedback avenue, and he gave me a link. i clicked on that link, which took me out of the cs chat and ended the session, so there was no way for me to go back. at the link, i realised that it was a generic feedback for itunes support, which seemed entirely wrong to me. i couldn't go back to rep #3, so i started a new chat - this is rep #4 - and asked how i could make a complaint about the interaction i had previously. rep #4 offered to put me in touch with her supervisor. 


so rep #5. this came after 2 hours of trying to sort out the matter, and i'd honestly given up by now. i told #5 that i was trying to make a complaint about the previous few reps i had spoken to, but the link i had been given did not seem to be the appropriate place as it was for itunes feedback. she assured me that i could use that link, but said that the 2 other options available were for me to make the complaint to her and she would refer it to the appropriate channel; or else, i could send a letter by post to a certain address. i said i really didn't see the purpose in sending a letter by post, and the other feedback link did not seem appropriate, so i would set it out in that chat and she could escalate it appropriately. 


i typed out a shorter version of what i've detailed above. i admit that it was a wall of text, but it started getting obvious after each message i sent that she was trying to end the conversation there and it did not seem that she was taking my complaint seriously. she kept asking, after each section, whether that was all, and if so, she would end the chat. after setting out my overall complaint and explaining why i was frustrated thus far, i said to her that i accepted that i was out of the sign up period, but whether this was something they could consider waiving given the circumstances. i summarised that i felt that i had wasted my time given rep #1's response, then my complaint that reps #2 and #3 seemed unprofessional. i repeated my request for one year commencing from 11 nov 2019. 


to my surprise, she essentially said that i had been offered 3 months already, she and no one else at apple were under no obligation to offer anything further and i would not receive any additional offer. she then said that, i paraphrase, ""it's obvious to me that you are not happy with the 3 months i'm offering you. that's your choice. i will be ending this chat here and will forward your complaint. have a nice day.""


and that was that. she closed the chat, and i have no further way to respond. i was in fact still typing when she closed the chat, and i think it would have been clear to her that i was still typing because i could see when she was typing a message. honestly, i don't even care about the apple tv+ subscription anymore. but i am honestly appalled at the way in which this was handled. i feel that rep #5 showed obvious disregard and annoyance with my complaint – when she was the one who offered that chat as an official avenue for complaint – and i do not expect her to forward my complaint to anyone. 

i want to be fair so i thought i’d summarise my general attitude here. i was polite with rep #1, and admitted numerous times it was my fault. i made clear to reps #2 to #4 that i was annoyed, and i accept that my tone in the messages could have been better, but i don’t think that i was rude. i did make it clear to reps #2 and #3 that i thought they were being unprofessional and that the general way this was being handled was poor. by the time i reached rep #5, i was simply trying to make a complaint, and did so because she told me that i should type the complaint to her in that chat. i don’t think my tone was rude or that i overstepped, and again, i made clear to her that i thought her previous colleagues had handled the matter poorly – only to suddenly get cut off in that way. 

i am not sure what my options are now. actuually, i honestly don’t care about the subscription anymore, but this isn’t the customer service i expected to receive.

the story begins here. apologies for the long wall of text. 


i purchased an ipad for my partner on 11 nov 2019. it came with the free one year apple tv+ subscription. i did not realise this had to be activated within 3 months of purchase, and i essentially forgot about it. i didn't receive the reminders because the ipad was registered under my partner's name so the reminders went to her email. i accept that up to here, this is all my fault. 


i realised in early march 2020 that the deadline to register for the free apple tv+ subscription had passed. the deadline would have been some time in early feb (not sure if its 3 months or 90 days, i've been told a number of different things by the various customer support people i spoke to), so i missed it by a few weeks to a month. 


i decided to contact apple support. this was on 7 march. i did so via the apple support chat link, so it was a live chat with one of the cs staff. i was, at this point, very apologetic. i said i knew it was my fault that i had missed the deadline to sign up, but since it was only a few weeks, was there something that could be done? i admit that at this point, i thought it would be a very routine encounter - someone would admonish me for missing the deadline, activate the one year subscription, and that would be that. this was not the case. 


the cs rep (rep #1) i spoke to said he would do his best to assist. he asked when i had purchased the device, and for proof of purchase. i gave him the date, but said that i was not able to find the receipt. i said that the device had been registered on 11 nov 2019, which was the day i had bought the ipad - wouldn't that be sufficient? he said no, unfortunately there was nothing he could do until i found the physical receipt, and that i had to find it before he could assist me. he suggested contacting the store that i'd purchased the device from to ask for a copy. he gave a case number so i could follow up once i found the receipt, and i said i didn't really see how it made a difference, but ok. the conversation ended there. i don't have a log of the conversation with rep #1, but my understanding at this point was that if i found the receipt, there wouldn't be any issue and he'd grant an extension and i receive my one year. so i went to search for the receipt for quite some time, couldn't find it, and decided to give up. 


the next week - 16 march - i had a free day, so i decided to follow his advice and go to the shop which i had bought the ipad from. thankfully, they managed to locate my purchase and printed out another copy of the receipt for me. i then contacted customer support again using the follow-up case number that rep #1 gave me. i was put in touch with rep #2. i provided him the receipt.

when you fill out a customer service survey sent out to apple retail customers, on the backend the questions trickle down to nps (net promoter score) and tms (team member score). when you're asked to rate 1/5 ""how did zed do?"" that gets filed under tms. when you're asked to rate 1/5 ""what was your overall experience with apple today?"" that gets filed under nps.

1-3 are considered detractors. 4 is passive. 5 is a promoter. anything other than 5 brings down the employee's nps and tms. every comment you leave is able to be read by the managers and the employee that either checked you out (sales), took your appointment (support), or lead your today at apple session (forum).

internally, employees receive a raise once a year. multiple factors play into the percentage an employee makes. an employee's nps is one of those factors, tms is not. also not the only factor, but nps is discussed when employees go for promotions as well, tms is almost never discussed.

so lets pretend you checked in for your genius bar appointment, everything was running on time *(this is theoretical, btw),* the genius who took your appointment was courteous and efficient  when checking in your cracked screen repair, but there were complications with the repair, poor communication in the repair room, and then the genius admin was unprofessional and did not apologise appropriately when your device was 2hrs late. in this scenario, you legitimately had a bad experience. for the most part, apple retail works very well. there is just such high volume that the scenario i describe is bound to happen to some customers (even if it's just one customer per store per day). if you answer that customer survey as the questions are asked and rate the genius who took your appointment highly but rate the overall store poorly, the only person's nps you're lowering is the genius who took your appointment.

15,74,1578626046,1,"i recently received a hand-me-down 2015 macbook 12"" from my father after helping him with some tech issues with his other computer. he offered it up not really knowing if it was worth keeping and i happily accepted it. i noticed after taking it home that it had some minor cosmetic issues and a small bend on the top case at the upper right corner. the bottom was not sitting flush anymore (but wasn't horribly ajar) and at first i was worried it was a bloated battery but it turned out that the top case was just bent. 

i installed a fresh version of catalina and began setting up the macbook when i noticed that the battery life was pretty bad. it turned out that he had stopped using the machine because of the battery in the first place, he'd been quoted some ridiculous price (by the geek squad no less) and had just purchased a new work laptop because it seemed easier. i figured it would be worth the $200 quoted on the apple repair page seeing as i had no other skin in the game for this particular machine. i booked my appointment, took it in and spoke to a tech who said it would be sent out for repair with a quote of $200. he mentioned the dents and scratches on the top case and i replied that i wasn't really worried about the cosmetic damage to the laptop as it was not having a negative impact on performance. he stated that most of the time the top case is just replaced with new batteries attached so i'd very likely get most of that repaired for free. i thanked him for his time and took off.

this morning i received an email from apple with a new quote of $475 dollars for repair of my macbook. i called and spoke with a technical support specialist who advised me that apple would only perform *total repairs* and not partial repairs. i let the tech know that the technician i spoke with in person told me that most battery replacements came with a complete top case replacement because the batteries were glued in and it was just easier for apple, and never once mentioned that i would be on the hook for more repair fees. i also told him i was not worried about the cosmetic issues, or even upset about the cost, but the fact that i had been told incorrect information in the first place. he apologized and said i could pay the new quote and have my macbook repaired or have the computer shipped back as is. i asked to speak to his direct supervisor, to which he told me he was a senior technical support team member. i then asked to be transferred to someone else, and eventually he got me in contact with customer relations.

after explaining my issues with the customer relations employee i was put on hold for a few minutes, she checked to see what options were available to help me. in the end she was able to waive the top case repair fee because i had been given incorrect information at the start of the whole process. during the first part of this whole thing i was wondering if continuing to be an apple customer was worth it with that level of support, and in the end i have found that they continue to provide quality service when you need it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/emkyna/apple_customer_relations_turned_around_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/emkyna/apple_customer_relations_turned_around_a/,emkyna,37,apple customer relations turned around a frustrating experience..,0,"apple customer relations turned around a frustrating experience.. i recently received a hand-me-down 2015 macbook 12"" from my father after helping him with some tech issues with his other computer. he offered it up not really knowing if it was worth keeping and i happily accepted it. i noticed after taking it home that it had some minor cosmetic issues and a small bend on the top case at the upper right corner. the bottom was not sitting flush anymore (but wasn't horribly ajar) and at first i was worried it was a bloated battery but it turned out that the top case was just bent.

in hope someone at apple see this post, because its becoming ridiculous.

 i have been using an iphone since iphone 4, i am also a jailbreaker but this post isn't about jailbreak, but the mighty apple appstore. little bit about my background, i used to fix apple product, for a third party repair center for 4 years before moving to a govt job. 

i had a grudge against the appstore for a very long time and i think it is time to vent some bullshit out.

  this is really annoying in the appstore unless you know exactly what you are looking for, you will never find it unless its in the top 200ish of its category. this is a big problem because since most apps have more then 1 category, they are listed in more then 1 top200 and its hiding visibility to other apps. so one app can take x spot in y category hence taking spot for other smaller apps that could use the visibility. the only way around this is to browse the website appstore, but you cant on a mobile it automatically send you to the appstore app, no work around possible.

-no longer a new game/app section, the new app/game section has been changed for a long time and it only display what it seems to be 20ish apps chosen by someone at apple, instead of listing all apps in chronological order with date timestamps. this was my favorite section until it was broken by ""updates"", i would look for new games from a category and never miss a new good game i would like to play, now i only see what apple want me to see and its a pain in the ass, because of my next point too. before teh change, new games was in chronological orders and that was perfect, never missed an app/game that was released. it was the best section ever.

-the pre-order listing is gone/disabled since a bug not long ago (1-2 month) in us appstore, we can no longer pre-order games for couple months while on other appstore like japan or china, the pre-order are working as intended but in usa, pre-orders looks to be disabled for the time being, so this again make me miss new games/apps i would like to view in a list of new released games.

- the updated games listing is useless, games get updates almost every week, why do we need a listing for this but removed the pre-order and broken the new games listing, i just dont understand whoever took this decision.

-miss categorized apps/games, my favorite games category is role-playing, but you browse this awesome list of 200ish role-playing games but there are bowling games, pool games, makeup games, a puzzle game, since when all these are rpg games? a role playing games is a rpg a bowling game isn't... as of 01-07, super stylist, a hair dress game, how is this a rpg? my talking tom 1 and 2? a cat playing drums how is this a rpg ? diy fashion star... the list goes on an on... all these miss categorized games, and plus, they are listed in more then 1 category, so this diy fashion star games will be listed in action, roleplaying and more category, hence taking visibility spot from other apps that should be listed but arent. a big job of cleaning the miss category from games has to be done because its becoming ridiculous. and its just getting worst and worst with time. either the categories are wrong or we need more specific category, because a fashion game isnt roleplaying games. a role-playing game (sometimes spelled role playing game; abbreviated rpg) is a game in which players assume the roles of characters in a fictional setting. i understand that taking a role of a hairdresser could be considered role play, but there should be another category for these grey-zone not really rpg games. but you get my point.

-games we love is just another pay to view in the appstore chosen by apple or the highest bidder? remove this already and let the rating do the job it was supposed to do. a real game we love should already exist using the rating given by users, not by money.

long time reddit reader...first time poster.

i was hoping to get some opinions on the question - macbook air vs macbook pro.  both base models, both at a solid discount (through costco).  

full disclosure: i purchased the macbook air in december and it has been a solid machine for my very basic needs.  (browsing the web, listening to music, some youtube and light ms office use.)

i only worry about the 128gb of ssd space down the road, as well as the dual core processor, that, i will admit, does some to chug along if i open too many chrome tabs.

if you had the opportunity to return the air and get the pro with 256gb ssd, would you pay the additional $450 for: better processor, slightly better screen, touch bar, double the ssd space, better speakers.  or, is paying 50% more on top of what i paid for the air a bit...foolish?",https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/ekqsbe/macbook_air_base_799_vs_macbook_pro_base_w256gb/,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/ekqsbe/macbook_air_base_799_vs_macbook_pro_base_w256gb/,ekqsbe,0,macbook air (base) $799 vs macbook pro (base w/256gb ssd) $1249.,0,"macbook air (base) $799 vs macbook pro (base w/256gb ssd) $1249. hello to all,

long time reddit reader...first time poster.

i was hoping to get some opinions on the question - macbook air vs macbook pro.  both base models, both at a solid discount (through costco).

54,462,1578279889,1,"got an iphone 11 pro right before thanksgiving, and i noticed it did something weird when i plugged it in to a docking station via aux cord + dongle: it kept skipping forward the song a little bit at a regular interval, and then siri kept turning on.

i brushed it off as just something weird with the plug (which doesn't make too much sense).  

just now, i had it plugged in again, and i noticed that when i touch the edge of the phone, the speakers get an interference sound similar to when you hold the end of a cable.  similarly, i had my forearm slightly touching the edge of the phone, and i felt a small shock (you can do this with a connected aux cord too.  it's a very small shock, but it happens since such a small contact point builds potential better). 

this implies that some of the electricity from the aux is going to other parts of the phone (which would explain how it turned siri on.  i guess the phone figured the button was being pressed).

it's called **primalist**.

[**app store link**](http://apple.co/2mqnbxx) (all functionality is free, although you can purchase wallpapers or leave tip if you'd like)

it's a simple to-do list app (we have a lot of those, i know!).

but it holds **only 7 tasks at a time**. so it's always short, always meaningful, never overwhelming.

that also means now you need to really take a few minutes and ask yourself - **""what's really, actually going to make the biggest difference to my day?""** because only the things that matter most go into one of those 7 slots.

you can set a **timer, a reminder, and flag** for each task.

it's also got some **cool wallpapers** that you can purchase as a set. the feel of the app changes with the wallpaper you choose.

my name is simone montalto and i recently published my first personal application on the app store.

it's called **book track** and allows you to easily keep track of the books you've purchased or would like to buy. you can add a new book to the collection or to the wish list by searching for it by title, author or isbn, by scanning the barcode or by entering it manually. the entire collection is automatically synchronized on all the devices connected to your apple account via icloud.

during the development of book track, i wanted to focus a lot on ease of use, creating an app that fully integrates with the operating system in terms of user experience and ui. furthermore, no registration is required.

75,722,1578083504,1,"i just took my 2018 macbook air into the apple store to take advantage of the extended keyboard service program they’re offering, since this is apple’s way of admitting they did something wrong. let me start by saying that i absolutely love this machine. i’m a fan of the new keyboard’s travel and type feel, and as someone who does a lot of typing, it’s been a pleasure to use...or at least it was until my command key stopped working reliably. i use keyboard shortcuts constantly, and every time it wouldn’t respond, i’d end up registering a tab press in the active window and i’d have to undo and try again. when you’re trying to take meeting or interview notes on the fly and switch between windows quickly, these small annoyances can add up to a serious productivity bottleneck. 

i’ve been putting off taking the machine in. i work freelance, and there haven’t been many times in the recent past where i could be without a laptop for 3-5 days. so i waited until yesterday—3 or 4 days after my limited warranty expired. with 4 days still left on my holiday break, i’d have time to finally get this fixed! 

i was kind of excited to bring the machine in, because i’ve also been wanting to test out the ipad only life. i still use my ipad air 2 daily, and i’ve enjoyed all of the multitasking improvements that have been added to ios 13 (most of which run surprisingly well on my aging tablet!)

i’ve had a pretty good year in the financial department, so i thought i’d buy the 12.9” pro and the smart keyboard folio to play around with while my machine was with the doctor. when i returned to pick up my mba, i could either return the pro (taking advantage of 14 day return policy) or keep it and sell the repaired mba. either way, i’m not out a primary computing device for 3-5 days, and i get a fun new gadget to play around with.

i’m typing this post from the ipad. it’s only been 24 hours, and i can already tell this isn’t going to work for me. while i love using my smaller ipad for web browsing and some light emailing/document creation, it’s always acted as a complementary computing device. with the ipad pro, i figured the larger size, coupled with the additional horsepower, would give me a primary workspace build around task focus. as someone who gets distracted easily, i’ll often have to stop myself from tabbing between 5-6 windows, or jumping back and forth between work stuff and fun stuff. even with the new multitasking improvements, ipados has always excelled at a single task workflow. since most of my work involves writing and research, anything that would help me stay on task would be welcomed. 

i’m also not an artist or “creator” or any sort—i don’t need the precision of the apple pencil, or the low response latency. i just need a computer with a keyboard that’s not going to stop working every year, and i’d prefer it to be running macos or ipados. 

unanticipated problems i’m having with this setup:

**scrolling**

this is actually one of the biggest issues that i didn’t even think about beforehand. we’re all used to chastising laptop makers for including touchscreens because of the dreaded “gorilla arm,” and the ipad pro—at least the 12.9 model—is no different. while i do appreciate the smooth scrolling you’re able to get with the arrow keys in safari, not being able to scroll with a trackpad is giving me an arm cramp. 

**the smart keyboard folio**

this was a big part of the reason i was considering moving to ipad. after trying this keyboard out in store, i was a fan of the typing experience, and i appreciated the completely sealed design. what i didn’t think about was the stability of this setup when i’m lounging on a couch or lying in bed, which is where i do a good amount of my work/play on my laptop (work from home). unless i’m sitting on my couch in a perfectly upright position with my legs parallel to each other, the ipad/keyboard combo is wobbly as hell. 

**smudges**

this is a personal problem, but with a screen this large, i cannot stand trying to look past a sea of fingerprints and smudges when i’m trying to work or watch content. it’s not really an issue on my air 2, but i suspect that’s because i’m holding it closer to my face and at an angle where they aren’t as noticeable. i’m a fastidious screen cleaner, to the point where i’ve had several colleagues and friends call me out for obsessively cleaning my macbook screen at least once a day. it’s driving me crazy, and i’ve become extremely picky about when i’ll actually use the touchscreen, negating the purpose of using a large tablet. 

**ios 13**

while apple has definitely turned multitasking on the ipad into a much more thought out and functional experience, there are still too many limitations with the way ios manages ram—even on the most recent update—to make a full replacement viable for me. when it comes to processing power, this machine is a beast. so why does the music app reload completely when return to the window after a short while? why aren’t all of my safari tabs staying loaded in memory? 

these are just a few of the problems i’ve been having with this test setup. taken individually, they might not seem like a big deal, but when you add them all up together, i’m left yearning for my classic, boring notebook. i still love my macbook, but i know i’ll probably need to take it in for the keyboard again...and again

one of my airpod pro rubber ear tips tore in half trying to replace them so i called this apple store to see if they had them in stock. there is no way to check this in the apple store on your phone. the woman at the store said they would transfer me to apple care, which i thought was weird, and they told me that they were not allowed to tell me if they had them in stock at store and that the only way to see if they had them in stock was to show up to the store. i was already a little annoyed but told them i would drive 30 minutes to the apple store to see if they were available. note: this would have been a great time to tell me i needed to bring my airpods with i me!! as you will see later, this wasn’t told to me until the last possible moment. 

so i finally get to the store and tell the person up front what i am looking for. one set of medium airpod pro ear tips. there were three people i spoke to in quick succession, each one telling me something different until i was ultimately told to go wait by a table. about 5 minutes later a person comes up to me and tells me they do have them in stock and to check in with a girl in the middle. i check in with the girl in the middle who directs me to another table at the opposite side. about 5 minutes later a person comes up to me and tells me  that they can only sell me size small or large but if i want to buy a medium, i would have to book an appointment with the genius bar. this already made no sense to me but i didn’t argue. before he left to put me in the cue i said, “btw, i don’t have the airpods with me. that isn’t going to be a problem is it?” he assured me it wouldn’t. 

edit: lol i just remembered this detail that was kind of weird. the employee who told me about the genius bar also told me they could sell me a pair of small or large ear tips right now, but i needed to make a genius bar appointment for the mediums. literally i could have bought the smalls or large a without a serial number, but the mediums were off limit to me without one.

so after waiting 15 minutes i get called to the genius bar and explain my whole situation and what i’m looking for and the first thing he asks is if i have my airpods with me. i said no and that i told the person who made the appointment for me this and they told me it wouldn’t be a problem. i tried to explain the situation and who i had called over an hour ago and they wouldn’t even tell me if they sold them unless i showed up in a physical store and never mentioned bringing them.

long story short i made the 30 minute drive home empty handed because apple is frustrating bureaucratic and each team so separated that no one could give me a correct answer out of the 7 different people i spoke to. by far the worst/most frustrating customer experience of my life and i am going to be looking for alternatives than go back there. i’m usually unfazed by burdensome company policies but this was so beyond bizarre and left a bad taste in my mouth.

while i completely understand that, it still feels like shit to see my phone “fully charged” at 80%.

i think they should keep the feature exactly as-is under the hood, but change the way the data is displayed to the user.

instead of a “nominal full charge” being 80% and “actual max capacity” being 100%, i propose:

make “nominal full capacity” 100%.  
make “actual max capacity” 125%.

name the feature something like “overcharge” — your phone is *over* it’s nominal charge limit by 25%.  this approach has several wins:

first, by conveying that it’s “overcharged”, the end user is primed to expect some long-term consequence — like overclocking a computer component, overspending on your budget, or overeating on the holidays.  it’s *doable*, certainly, but it *shouldn’t be considered normal*.

second, by branding the feature as “more than the maximum”, you can make it an opt-in setting for power users (no pun intended).  opting out of being limited to 80% *feels bad*.  opting in to getting 25% extra *feels good* — even though they’re functionally identical.

the usb-c ports block wifi signal as soon as any dongle is connected. i brought it back to the third party retailer who sold me the 70 dollar usb-c to a normal usb-b dongle along with the macbook. they said they wont replace it until i prove its a problem with the macbook not the dongle which they sold me. i was in the middle.of moving country. bought another dongle abroad for 50 euro.  same thing happened. rang up apple. they put back to retailer to replace. had to live with this problem for a year. until i returned on holiday to this retailer. replaced laptop. same problem exists. i had bought 2 dongles just for a normal usb connection, a dongle for a hdmi connection, and a hard drive lead to plug directly (and not all cheap china stuff) and all had problems cutting off wifi. apple will say ""we can't guarentee any third party accessories will work""

not only those posted everyday in /r/iosbeta, not only those posted by me frequently via feedback, which are always ignored. i'm mostly talking about those present in ""stable"" versions of software.

the problem is serious, because the low stability of software brought us to the point where lots of bugs that are affecting our expensive devices are *""random""*...well it's wrong word, what i mean is they're just very hard or almost impossible to reproduce. these are all kinds of freezes, performance slowdowns, unexpected behaviors (e.g. ipad's screen remains black for 5-10 secs until its being unlocked), unreliable syncing, etc etc.

 i search google for every bug i experience and i always end up on apple forums in at least one topic about it and hundreds of people saying ""i have the same problem"", sometimes comments from couple of years behind.

# apple should stop implementing new features

remember not so far times, when we all had the ios11 on board, and there was an announced successor called ios12 on the way, which was supposed to not bring many new features, but rather focus on bug fixes and improvements?  

if you ask me, it is now worse than ever before. ios12 was not a bad move in my opinion, but it also wasn't good. it was just necessary. and *shit, here we go again*. apple is following the same direction which leads to another release like this. again.if it's not ios14, it will be 15, whatever.

my thread is a river of cries about the well-known **ecosystem,** including ios13, ipados, macos10.15.2, tvos13, watchos6 and airpods - these are the parts i use. i think this combo was never that buggy before.

# what the hell are you blabling about

well, i'm talking about the situation i'm experiencing on my mac currently (when writing this), where i tried to access the network drive on my local, making the finder freeze and hang (because the drive indeed couldn't be reached). after force close, it's impossible to start it again, because it's frozen since the beginning and the only option i have is to ""restart"" it again via right mouse click menu - which also doesn't help. removing plist setting file via terminal doesn't work, and killing the process also doesnt do anything, coz the process ""not matched"".

i'm talking about the situation i'm experiencing on my mac currently, where clicking on the apple on the top bar and hovering onto the ""recent items"" freezes the opened app forever, no matter what app it is, everytime. funny to see something like this on 16gb ram computer.

i'm talking about the bugs in ios music app, where the drag-drop on currently-playing list is glitched so much it jumps crazily with only slight move.

i'm talking about all the freezes and massive performance and battery problems started to happen on my ipad mini 4 after going to ipados (shit i regret this decision so much!!). talking about the tablet which stopped being responsive, especially in system apps like settings, where its currently usual to get couple-seconds hangs while navigating. also, some of recently implemented views are buggy, just try to go to ipad storage section, and if you have some netflix stuff stored on the device, you should have an option to list the videos on your device. it's freezing the screen when trying to render the list, also its freezing it again if you want to interact with any of the files (deleting a movie is actually the only option to interact).

i'm talking about the tvos new interesting behavior, which makes my atv4k to forget the credentials for icloud after every restart.

i'm talking about the problem which i've experienced yesterday, when tvos13's youtube app decided to freeze, just after navigating to it from music app. i could play the video, but i couldn't move up or down. maybe youtube app's fault, maybe not. i wouldn't be surprised if not.

i'm talking about the tvos hdcp errors which happened to me in 2019 a lot. hdcp stands for high bandwidth digital content protection.  problem was that after waking up atv from sleep after some hours, it couldnt play any of the video - no matter if netflix or hbogo. the video was black-screen frozen and after a minute or so the hdcp error came in. the solution was a restart. but it was pretty damn annoying that i had to restart it almost everytime. this problem is usually solved by replacing hdmi cable, i tried several, but it was the same. worth mention, this was the only single time when i actually received a response from apple team after reporting it. they asked for tv model. some time after that the issue was gone, without any tvos update (!). i haven't experienced it since then (half year?), i just recently had one black screen that forced me to restart. well, i used the atv3 before for over a year and it was way more stable than atv4k.

...i'm talking about the mac mail app, which started to randomly show up once per hour, taking half of the screen, without showing anything new.

i'm talking about mac safari browser which barely handles opening a new tab. i didn't know it is soo demanding task, but i just don't accept the couple secs freezes after clicking the +.

i'm talking about that scary 2-seconds blink of black&amp;white noise screen saying like my graphic card should be replaced, when unlocking my mac. it happens sometimes, looks scaaary. 

i'm talking about random total freezes after being idle for some time [https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/120154](https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/120154) \- even the touchpad stops ""clicking"".

i'm talking about failures in communicating with apple watch, where it's supposed to unlock the mac's screen, but randomly the feature stops working.

i'm talking again about the finder and its built in photos viewer, which probably and for some reason indexes the newly shot photos differently than the actual photos app. what i mean is that i can see the newest photos in photos app pretty quick, but have to wait/trying to refresh for couple minutes to have it in finder.

i'm talking about those stupid behaviors of finder, where selecting 30 files and choosing ""getting information"" opens 30 information windows. that's not a bug, maybe even a feature, but hellooo, 2020??

i'm talking about the buggy sensitivity of apple watch gestures when using it with ""now playing"" (not sure if translated correctly) app together with tvos. one swipe is equivalent to a scroll of 20 songs. kinda hard to shoot the one i want.

i'm talking about the apple watch remote app, which doesn't recognize well my apple tv and sometimes says it cannot be found, but it is in the same exact  network.

i'm talking about ios feature, where you hold the bluetooth icon in control center in order to show the list of devices. it's cool idea, but please work on it more. when the phone is locked (!) and you open control center, tap and hold bluetooth, it prompts for the fingerprint. but why does it turn off the bluetooth?? i mean, i know why - because i stopped holding the icon. seriously, it shouldn't behave like this. also, if the phone is unlocked and i tap and hold the bluetooth, i want to release the finger and scroll the devices list. unfortunately it doesn't work like this, if i release the finger while on the list, it selects the device my finger was on and keeps loading for 10-15secs because it cant find it, lol. annoying.

i'm talking about the problems with mac update software functionality which i experienced some time ago. i was on beta of catalina and in the meantime the stable version came out so i had to delete the beta profile in order to go back. well, it didn't work. the profile was removed indeed, but the version of macos stayed as beta as it was. which of course made it impossible to find a newer version of stable! (i was stuck on 10.15.0 beta i think, and there was 10.15.2 stable already out, but mac kept saying it is up to date). i don't remember exactly, i tried combo updates (none worked, lol ""the partition does not meet requirements""), i ended up running installer again, which looked so much like installing a fresh copy (and yes, for whole time of the process i was not sure if it will wipe the system setup or not. anyway it did not, but i had to go through the ""first setup"" anyway, wtf mr apple?).

i'm talking about the airpods and their hangs or connection failures, where the only option to make them work again is to put them back into the charging box for 20 mins or re-pair. not talking only about situation where one of pods stops playing, but also both. i've also had that bad experience, where airpods are making the device they're connected to unresponsive (both watch and iphone). happens pretty random, usually  when i take it out from my ear for 30sec, put in in pocket and then put it back into ear. after that the pods are connected via bt, but unresponsive, and makes apple watch or iphone stutter and lag everytime i try to play music.

i'm also talking about slow icloud servers, which makes it impossible to smooth play videos i've recently recorded with my phone. no matter what internet connection, viewing the icloud photo galleries and especially the videos is just a pain.  if compared to google, hmm, no words. i heard icloud is actually sitting on google servers, but doesn't matter i guess. what matters is that i'm paying for icloud and get a pretty slow service. i do get better from google for free. 

# feedback? what for? waste of time?

i'm talking about apple not being able to react on provided feedbacks. i've submitted more than 20 reports since september, pointing out bugs in either ***stable*** or beta versions. none of these was ever updated with status change. no response at all, no fix for any of these. i recently stopped doing that, so i save some time for restarts or other funny activities like scratching my head.

# switch to android?

tried, no.

# apple hardware

i'm not the guy who buys apple stuff every year. so i won't complain much here. i'm on mac pro 2015 which i'm still happy with, yes, even considering the bugs i described, but someday you know, it will be time for a change. and i'm afraid when will this ""someday"" arrive, because i heard too many complaints about 2016+ models. the recent 16' looks better, hopefully we'll see some 13-inch models also.

i'm talking about the airpods and their hangs or connection failures, where the only option to make them work again is to put them back into the charging box for 20 mins or re-pair. not talking only about situation where one of pods stops playing, but also both. i've also had that bad experience, where airpods are making the device they're connected to unresponsive (both watch and iphone). happens pretty random, usually  when i take it out from my ear for 30sec, put in in pocket and then put it back into ear. after that the pods are connected via bt, but unresponsive, and makes apple watch or iphone stutter and lag everytime i try to play music.

i'm also talking about slow icloud servers, which makes it impossible to smooth play videos i've recently recorded with my phone. no matter what internet connection, viewing the icloud photo galleries and especially the videos is just a pain.  if compared to google, hmm, no words. i heard icloud is actually sitting on google servers, but doesn't matter i guess. what matters is that i'm paying for icloud and get a pretty slow service. i do get better from google for free. 

# feedback? what for? waste of time?

i'm talking about apple not being able to react on provided feedbacks. i've submitted more than 20 reports since september, pointing out bugs in either ***stable*** or beta versions. none of these was ever updated with status change. no response at all, no fix for any of these. i recently stopped doing that, so i save some time for restarts or other funny activities like scratching my head.

# switch to android?

tried, no.

# apple hardware

i'm not the guy who buys apple stuff every year. so i won't complain much here. i'm on mac pro 2015 which i'm still happy with, yes, even considering the bugs i described, but someday you know, it will be time for a change. and i'm afraid when will this ""someday"" arrive, because i heard too many complaints about 2016+ models. the recent 16' looks better, hopefully we'll see some 13-inch models also.

i have currently two options, either buying macbook pro mid-2014 or late-2013. both from second-hand sellers, the second from a refurbisher. which would you buy?

pros and cons of each model here:

there is no internal difference outside of the fact that 2014 model has slightly better processor. exact same specs regarding ram and space (16gb, 256g)

the mid-2014 model: (700€)

\+ perfect condition. not even a single scratch. great re-sell value if a need ever comes for that?

\+ has only 340 battery cycles 

\- the model is 100€ more expensive vs. the other model

the late-2013 model: (600€)

\+ comes with a 12-month warranty, sold by a re-furbisher

\- has 410 battery cycles - not bad, but slightly worse than the 2014 model

\- has few ""hair scratches"" on the screen

it appears this also rings true for a lot of other countries, not just canada, based on other posts on this subreddit and other parts of the internet i've seen. i know apple being the monolith they are doesn't really need to listen to us, but anyone have any ideas we can maybe bring this to apple's attention? i can't be the only one who feels this way."

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
dear mr. cook, dear mr. wiilliams,   


i have to write to you directly because my customer service problem seems to be too difficult that even 2 apple senior advisors weren't able to help me yet.   
you might ask what can be that difficult, so i tell you that i somehow lost the original invoice of my apple watch 4 and i just ask for a copy to send to me by email.   


when i thought about getting me the applewatch4 i checked prices and found that i get the best price when i buy directly with apple usa.   
so i bought my watch online on january 5 and paid 467,07 us$ with my visa card.   
serial no. of my watch is xxxxxxxxxxxxxx   


because apple only delivers within usa i used a forwarding company to get the watch to the philippines where i reside.   
now you might object that this is not the official way, then yes, but it's not different from people buying gadgets in the usa during holidays and flying back to their home country.   


as now the battery of my watch starts to drain, i need to bring it to an authorized repair center here in cebu, and for that i need my invoice.   
when i noticed that i must have lost it i tried to look it up online, but to my surprise i also don't see that invoice when i login with my appleid.   
that might be something to evaluate further in upcoming emails but for now it's not the point.   


because i didn't see my invoice online i tried to contact the apple hardware store in the usa, but unfortunately i have no way to directly email them, the way i prefer to use.   
the apple us store offers a 1-800 number that i cannot call by cellphone from the philippines.   
so i tried the philippine hotline number which is also a 1-800 but only to hear ""the number you've tried to call has already been disconnected"".   


so i chatted with apple service, but unfortunately i only end up with agents outside the usa and unable to help me.   
i'm now at a point after weeks of trying that i had emailed with 2 apple senior advisors, one in singapore and another in australia.   
i told them both my story and they both could see my data, but were unable to help me.   
they told me that only the store in usa can help me but i also told them that i cannot reach the store by cellphone.   
so we were stuck.   


then, when i asked them why they can't just transfer my tickt to the guys in usa, they only answered that they have no way to do that!   
that really left me shocked as simple email from one department to another really is the simplest and easiest way of internal communication in any company worldwide!   
and they just told me that that process isn't available or allowed at apple.   


thats why i have no other way tan to ask mr. williams as apples longterm coo, why a senior advisor is unable to help a customer.   
why they cannot just send an internal email to solve a problem in the simplest of ways!   
if that is true then let me ask you as apples longterm coo, why is this simple process not available within apples customer service?   


but as mr. williams email isn't available to the public i have to ask the favour of forwarding my email to him of you mr. cook.   
i hope mr. williams can explain and fix that procedural issue fast and then also reply to me with just the asked copy of my invoice as a pdf.

now i looking for something else and not sure what will be the best choice:

i plan to change the hdd for an ssd drive (samsung 860 evo or crucial mx500). before doing so, i wonder if i can upgrade my osx to high sierra, mojave or catalina.

is there any compatibility issues with these ssd and os x versions?

if not, should i upgrade my current macbook pro with the hdd to the osx version i want before copying my hdd data to the new ssd? 

how should i proceed ?

thank you so much in advance for your help!

asked for an ipad pro this christmas and was hoping for the usb c 11 inch one. my mother decided to get a lightning one in rose gold, which i absolutely hate as a colour. whilst i’m enjoying the ipad and would be content with just having a space grey or silver one, i don’t know how to go about apple’s holiday returns policy, i’m in the uk.

1. can i get my ipad exchanged for a different colour? or even pay the excess to get a usb c ipad pro? 
2. can i do this in store if the ipad was bought refurbished from apple online?
3. do i need the receipt and if i do how do i negotiate this with my mother? i’m very grateful for this gift and i don’t want to offend her.

3 days ago i was very surprised that my account will close in the next 14 days, and i asked support for giving me the reason why my game has been closed, and also why my account will close in the next 14 days. they told me that they can't give me details and my case was closed and they can't answer my questions anymore. i was very surprised because i have only one game, i tried to make it amazing.   
i really don't know why apple did that. if just someone can show me what's wrong i did.

* both aren't dedicated gpus, and aren't good enough for heavy gaming.

to conclude, both are comparable in terms of cpu performance and thermals (both around 89 degrees). however, the gpu in the 13"" mbp performances better (intel uhd 620 vs iris plus 645), along with a faster ssd.

***display:***

the highest i hit on my x1gen7's display is 356 nits, and 488 nits on my mbp. both essentially have the same resolution (2560 x 1440//2560 x 1600), and both support professional grade color-reproduction and wide gamut. however, the 13"" mbp's display is better, ranked at #4 (vs #11 of x1gen7) from [notebookcheck](https://www.notebookcheck.net/the-best-notebook-displays-as-reviewed-by-notebookcheck.120541.0.html). the 13"" mbp also has a 16:10 aspect ratio vs 16:9, giving it more room for scrolling/productivity.

another upside of the 13"" mbp display is its image/text scaling. tldr, macos does a better job of scaling various image/text sizes. the reason why many professionals use macs is because of the better scaling and color consistency/calibration, especially since you’re working with higher resolution workflows and need to frequently rescale. it’ll be a lot wiser to have the better scaling from macos in this case. true tone is also useful when the ambient lighting changes in your surroundings, but for maximum color accuracy/consistency i'd recommend you to turn it off. the 13"" mbp display also has a better reflective coating and better viewing angles.

if you're getting the touchscreen:

touchscreen/touchbar wise both aren’t too useful in my opinion. with the touchscreen you can scroll/touch links i guess? but most of the time it‘s really awkward/annoying because i have to reach further from my keyboard when i’m working—which slows down my workflow—when i can just use the trackpad which is not only closer, but also more accurate/easier to use than touch. i also find that besides the scrolling here and there, i barely use it. also, it’s a huge fingerprint magnet and messes up your screen. touchbar is slightly better because you can customize your keys and it’s actually useful for some workflows, but the problem is that it lacks app support and it sometimes freezes/is more convenient to have physical keys most of the times.

***build/others***

thickness and weight wise, both are essentially the same (0.59 inch 2.9 pounds x1gen7/ 0.59 inch 3.02 pounds mbp). both are very well-built machines. the x1gen7 is made from a mix of magnesium and plastic (they call it ""carbon fiber"" but that's just another fancy way of saying plastic), and the 13"" mbp of 100% aluminum. both are very durable and solid machines, but i do prefer the 100% aluminum of the mbp a lot more.

the difference between battery life is also significant (up to 3 hours more on the mbp). regarding performance when not plugged in, the x1gen7 can handle light usage like photo editing and media consumption without dropping in performance. but for more complicated tasks such as photoshop/video editing/light gaming, there is still a significant drop in performance (around 35-60% depending) when compared to the mbp that stays roughly the same (less than 10% drop) without being plugged in. as a result of constant charging for higher performance, the x1gen7’s battery deteriorates faster in the long run. my x1gen4's battery life has already dropped by roughly 50% (3-4 hours battery life), whereas my 2016 mbp still gives me over 8-9 hours on the same tasks.

it’s still clear to me that the track-pad and speakers on the mbp are a tier above other windows laptops. the track-pad on the x1gen7 is great, but it' still not as good or big as the one apple offers. speakers on the 13"" mbp are surprisingly loud and clear, compared to the audio on the x1gen7 that tends to get muddy on the low end, and static on the highs. keyboard wise, the 4th gen butterfly is very stable. personally, i never had an issue with them before--even with my 2016 mbp--and i enjoy the low-travel of the butterflies, however, the keyboard on the x1gen7 is top-tier, and i would say it's generally better for most people. the x1gen7 also has a much better port selection, and a replaceable ssd (although ram is soldered on). you can spend $30 more for a [port adapter](https://www.amazon.com/flujo-adapter-function-delivery-macbook/dp/b07y9rf9q4/ref=sr_1_9?crid=263uwyg375dv&amp;amp;keywords=macbook+pro+port+adapter&amp;amp;qid=1576612915&amp;amp;sprefix=macbook+pro+port+ad%2caps%2c374&amp;amp;sr=8-9) for the 13"" mbp, but both the ram/ssd is soldered on which is a bummer. both comes with 1 year warranty.

to conclude, the 13"" mbp and the x1gen7 are one of the best ultra-books you can get for non-heavy usage. if you're looking for a high quality device for average workflows with some light gaming on the side, then these are it. for heavier users, i would opt for the 16"" mbp or the thinkpad x1 extreme, since both of those have higher end cpus and dedicated gpus. however, if sticking with a certain os isn't an issue and you're not using your laptop for heavy programs/games, then i would personally go for the 13"" mbp **since it has 3 hours more of battery life, a better display, better gpu, a better track-pad, and a faster ssd**\----but if you need the extra storage and want to add in your own, then the x1gen7 is the way to go/or if you just enjoy using lenovo's keyboards. in general though, i'd recommend the 13"" mbp especially since it's $200 off right now at [b&amp;h](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1492879-reg/apple_muhp2ll_a_13_3_macbook_pro_with.html) for the holidays.",https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/ee7hdx/13_macbook_pro_vs_lenovo_thinkpad_x1carbon_gen/,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/ee7hdx/13_macbook_pro_vs_lenovo_thinkpad_x1carbon_gen/,ee7hdx,90,"13"" macbook pro vs lenovo thinkpad x1carbon gen 7--an in-depth comparison w/ benchmarks.",0,"13"" macbook pro vs lenovo thinkpad x1carbon gen 7--an in-depth comparison w/ benchmarks. this is a review of the 13"" mbp compared to the x1 carbon gen 7. both devices are on sale for the holidays.

another upside of the 13"" mbp display is its image/text scaling. tldr, macos does a better job of scaling various image/text sizes. the reason why many professionals use macs is because of the better scaling and color consistency/calibration, especially since you’re working with higher resolution workflows and need to frequently rescale. it’ll be a lot wiser to have the better scaling from macos in this case. true tone is also useful when the ambient lighting changes in your surroundings, but for maximum color accuracy/consistency i'd recommend you to turn it off. the 13"" mbp display also has a better reflective coating and better viewing angles.

if you're getting the touchscreen:

touchscreen/touchbar wise both aren’t too useful in my opinion. with the touchscreen you can scroll/touch links i guess? but most of the time it‘s really awkward/annoying because i have to reach further from my keyboard when i’m working—which slows down my workflow—when i can just use the trackpad which is not only closer, but also more accurate/easier to use than touch. i also find that besides the scrolling here and there, i barely use it. also, it’s a huge fingerprint magnet and messes up your screen. touchbar is slightly better because you can customize your keys and it’s actually useful for some workflows, but the problem is that it lacks app support and it sometimes freezes/is more convenient to have physical keys most of the times.

***build/others***

thickness and weight wise, both are essentially the same (0.59 inch 2.9 pounds x1gen7/ 0.59 inch 3.02 pounds mbp). both are very well-built machines. the x1gen7 is made from a mix of magnesium and plastic (they call it ""carbon fiber"" but that's just another fancy way of saying plastic), and the 13"" mbp of 100% aluminum. both are very durable and solid machines, but i do prefer the 100% aluminum of the mbp a lot more.

the difference between battery life is also significant (up to 3 hours more on the mbp). regarding performance when not plugged in, the x1gen7 can handle light usage like photo editing and media consumption without dropping in performance. but for more complicated tasks such as photoshop/video editing/light gaming, there is still a significant drop in performance (around 35-60% depending) when compared to the mbp that stays roughly the same (less than 10% drop) without being plugged in. as a result of constant charging for higher performance, the x1gen7’s battery deteriorates faster in the long run. my x1gen4's battery life has already dropped by roughly 50% (3-4 hours battery life), whereas my 2016 mbp still gives me over 8-9 hours on the same tasks.

it’s still clear to me that the track-pad and speakers on the mbp are a tier above other windows laptops. the track-pad on the x1gen7 is great, but it' still not as good or big as the one apple offers. speakers on the 13"" mbp are surprisingly loud and clear, compared to the audio on the x1gen7 that tends to get muddy on the low end, and static on the highs. keyboard wise, the 4th gen butterfly is very stable. personally, i never had an issue with them before--even with my 2016 mbp--and i enjoy the low-travel of the butterflies, however, the keyboard on the x1gen7 is top-tier, and i would say it's generally better for most people. the x1gen7 also has a much better port selection, and a replaceable ssd (although ram is soldered on). you can spend $30 more for a [port adapter](https://www.amazon.com/flujo-adapter-function-delivery-macbook/dp/b07y9rf9q4/ref=sr_1_9?crid=263uwyg375dv&amp;amp;keywords=macbook+pro+port+adapter&amp;amp;qid=1576612915&amp;amp;sprefix=macbook+pro+port+ad%2caps%2c374&amp;amp;sr=8-9) for the 13"" mbp, but both the ram/ssd is soldered on which is a bummer. both comes with 1 year warranty.

to conclude, the 13"" mbp and the x1gen7 are one of the best ultra-books you can get for non-heavy usage. if you're looking for a high quality device for average workflows with some light gaming on the side, then these are it. for heavier users, i would opt for the 16"" mbp or the thinkpad x1 extreme, since both of those have higher end cpus and dedicated gpus. however, if sticking with a certain os isn't an issue and you're not using your laptop for heavy programs/games, then i would personally go for the 13"" mbp **since it has 3 hours more of battery life, a better display, better gpu, a better track-pad, and a faster ssd**\----but if you need the extra storage and want to add in your own, then the x1gen7 is the way to go/or if you just enjoy using lenovo's keyboards. in general though, i'd recommend the 13"" mbp especially since it's $200 off right now at [b&amp;h](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1492879-reg/apple_muhp2ll_a_13_3_macbook_pro_with.html) for the holidays."

to conclude, both are comparable in terms of cpu performance and thermals (both around 89 degrees). however, the gpu in the 13"" mbp performances better (intel uhd 620 vs iris plus 645), along with a faster ssd.

***display:***

the highest i hit on my x1gen7's display is 356 nits, and 488 nits on my mbp. both essentially have the same resolution (2560 x 1440//2560 x 1600), and both support professional grade color-reproduction and wide gamut. however, the 13"" mbp's display is better, ranked at #4 (vs #11 of x1gen7) from [notebookcheck](https://www.notebookcheck.net/the-best-notebook-displays-as-reviewed-by-notebookcheck.120541.0.html). the 13"" mbp also has a 16:10 aspect ratio vs 16:9, giving it more room for scrolling/productivity.

thickness and weight wise, both are essentially the same (0.59 inch 2.9 pounds x1gen7/ 0.59 inch 3.02 pounds mbp). both are very well-built machines. the x1gen7 is made from a mix of magnesium and plastic (they call it ""carbon fiber"" but that's just another fancy way of saying plastic), and the 13"" mbp of 100% aluminum. both are very durable and solid machines, but i do prefer the 100% aluminum of the mbp a lot more.

the difference between battery life is also significant (up to 3 hours more on the mbp). regarding performance when not plugged in, the x1gen7 can handle light usage like photo editing and media consumption without dropping in performance. but for more complicated tasks such as photoshop/video editing/light gaming, there is still a significant drop in performance (around 35-60% depending) when compared to the mbp that stays roughly the same (less than 10% drop) without being plugged in. as a result of constant charging for higher performance, the x1gen7’s battery deteriorates faster in the long run. my x1gen4's battery life has already dropped by roughly 50% (3-4 hours battery life), whereas my 2016 mbp still gives me over 8-9 hours on the same tasks.

it’s still clear to me that the track-pad and speakers on the mbp are a tier above other windows laptops. the track-pad on the x1gen7 is great, but it' still not as good or big as the one apple offers. speakers on the 13"" mbp are surprisingly loud and clear, compared to the audio on the x1gen7 that tends to get muddy on the low end, and static on the highs. keyboard wise, the 4th gen butterfly is very stable. personally, i never had an issue with them before--even with my 2016 mbp--and i enjoy the low-travel of the butterflies, however, the keyboard on the x1gen7 is top-tier, and i would say it's generally better for most people. the x1gen7 also has a much better port selection, and a replaceable ssd (although ram is soldered on). you can spend $30 more for a [port adapter](https://www.amazon.com/flujo-adapter-function-delivery-macbook/dp/b07y9rf9q4/ref=sr_1_9?crid=263uwyg375dv&amp;keywords=macbook+pro+port+adapter&amp;qid=1576612915&amp;sprefix=macbook+pro+port+ad%2caps%2c374&amp;sr=8-9) for the 13"" mbp, but both the ram/ssd is soldered on which is a bummer. both comes with 1 year warranty.

to conclude, the 13"" mbp and the x1gen7 are one of the best ultra-books you can get for non-heavy usage. if you're looking for a high quality device for average workflows with some light gaming on the side, then these are it. for heavier users, i would opt for the 16"" mbp or the thinkpad x1 extreme, since both of those have higher end cpus and dedicated gpus. however, if sticking with a certain os isn't an issue and you're not using your laptop for heavy programs/games, then i would personally go for the 13"" mbp **since it has 3 hours more of battery life, a better display, better gpu, a better track-pad, and a faster ssd**\----but if you need the extra storage and want to add in your own, then the x1gen7 is the way to go. in general though, i'd recommend the 13"" mbp especially since it's $200 off right now at [b&amp;h](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1492879-reg/apple_muhp2ll_a_13_3_macbook_pro_with.html) for the holidays",https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/ee22my/13_macbook_pro_2019_vs_thinkpad_x1_carbon_gen_7an/,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/ee22my/13_macbook_pro_2019_vs_thinkpad_x1_carbon_gen_7an/,ee22my,12,"13"" macbook pro (2019) vs thinkpad x1 carbon gen 7---an in-depth comparison w/ benchmarks.",0,"13"" macbook pro (2019) vs thinkpad x1 carbon gen 7---an in-depth comparison w/ benchmarks. this is a review of the 13"" mbp compared to the x1 carbon gen 7. both devices are on sale for the holidays.

***performance:*** geekbench 5/cinebench/unigine heaven/black magic/crystal disk mark

geekbench 5 (cpu):

* average of 5 scores of x1gen7: **1045 (single-core)/3627 (multi-core)**
* average of 5 score of 13"" mbp: **1019 (single-core)/3881 (multi-core)**

cinebench 20 average of 5 (cpu):

* x1gen7: 1541
* 13"" mbp: 1663

black magic and crystal disk mark (ssd):

mbps always had the fastest ssds and it's no different here. the 13"" mbp has similar (slightly slower) hard-drive speed as the 15"" model in the real-world file transfer tests done by laptopmag/tomshardware: [x1gen7](https://prnt.sc/qbu0kq)//[x1gen7](https://prnt.sc/qbu1b7)//[13"" mbp](https://prnt.sc/pzq9zo)///[13"" mbp](https://prnt.sc/pzqes4)

* crystal disk mark--x1gen7: 2633 mb/s read and 1862mb/s write (doesn't reflect real-world performance)
* black magic--13"" mbp: 3094 mb/s read and 2881 mb/s write

3d mark fire strike (gpu):

* x1gen7: 1285
* 13"" mbp: 1632

cinebench 15r average of 5 (gpu):

* x1gen7: 22.7 fps/461 cb
* 13"" mbp: 35.19 fps/593 cb
* a gpu comparison from [notebookcheck.](https://www.notebookcheck.net/uhd-graphics-620-vs-iris-plus-graphics-645_8098_9902.247598.0.html)
* both aren't dedicated gpus, and aren't good enough for heavy gaming.

to conclude, both are comparable in terms of cpu performance and thermals (both around 89 degrees). however, the gpu in the 13"" mbp performances better (intel uhd 620 vs iris plus 645), along with a faster ssd.

***display:***

the highest i hit on my x1gen7's display is 356 nits, and 488 nits on my mbp. both essentially have the same resolution (2560 x 1440//2560 x 1600), and both support professional grade color-reproduction and wide gamut. however, the 13"" mbp's display is better, ranked at #4 (vs #11 of x1gen7) from [notebookcheck](https://www.notebookcheck.net/the-best-notebook-displays-as-reviewed-by-notebookcheck.120541.0.html). the 13"" mbp also has a 16:10 aspect ratio vs 16:9, giving it more room for scrolling/productivity.

another upside of the 13"" mbp display is its image/text scaling. tldr, macos does a better job of scaling various image/text sizes. the reason why many professionals use macs is because of the better scaling and color consistency/calibration, especially since you’re working with higher resolution workflows and need to frequently rescale. it’ll be a lot wiser to have the better scaling from macos in this case. true tone is also useful when the ambient lighting changes in your surroundings, but for maximum color accuracy/consistency i'd recommend you to turn it off. the 13"" mbp display also has a better reflective coating and better viewing angles.

if you're getting the touchscreen:

touchscreen/touchbar wise both aren’t too useful in my opinion. with the touchscreen you can scroll/touch links i guess? but most of the time it‘s really awkward/annoying because i have to reach further from my keyboard when i’m working—which slows down my workflow—when i can just use the trackpad which is not only closer, but also more accurate/easier to use than touch. i also find that besides the scrolling here and there, i barely use it. also, it’s a huge fingerprint magnet and messes up your screen. touchbar is slightly better because you can customize your keys and it’s actually useful for some workflows, but the problem is that it lacks app support and it sometimes freezes/is more convenient to have physical keys most of the times.

***build/others***

thickness and weight wise, both are essentially the same (0.59 inch 2.9 pounds x1gen7/ 0.59 inch 3.02 pounds mbp). both are very well-built machines. the x1gen7 is made from a mix of magnesium and plastic (they call it ""carbon fiber"" but that's just another fancy way of saying plastic), and the 13"" mbp of 100% aluminum. both are very durable and solid machines, but i do prefer the 100% aluminum of the mbp a lot more.

the difference between battery life is also significant (up to 3 hours more on the mbp). regarding performance when not plugged in, the x1gen7 can handle light usage like photo editing and media consumption without dropping in performance. but for more complicated tasks such as photoshop/video editing/light gaming, there is still a significant drop in performance (around 35-60% depending) when compared to the mbp that stays roughly the same (less than 10% drop) without being plugged in. as a result of constant charging for higher performance, the x1gen7’s battery deteriorates faster in the long run. my x1gen4's battery life has already dropped by roughly 50% (3-4 hours battery life), whereas my 2016 mbp still gives me over 8-9 hours on the same tasks.

it’s still clear to me that the track-pad and speakers on the mbp are a tier above other windows laptops. the track-pad on the x1gen7 is great, but it' still not as good or big as the one apple offers. speakers on the 13"" mbp are surprisingly loud and clear, compared to the audio on the x1gen7 that tends to get muddy on the low end, and static on the highs. keyboard wise, the 4th gen butterfly is very stable. personally, i never had an issue with them before--even with my 2016 mbp--and i enjoy the low-travel of the butterflies, however, the keyboard on the x1gen7 is top-tier, and i would say it's generally better for most people. the x1gen7 also has a much better port selection, and a replaceable ssd (although ram is soldered on). you can spend $30 more for a [port adapter](https://www.amazon.com/flujo-adapter-function-delivery-macbook/dp/b07y9rf9q4/ref=sr_1_9?crid=263uwyg375dv&amp;keywords=macbook+pro+port+adapter&amp;qid=1576612915&amp;sprefix=macbook+pro+port+ad%2caps%2c374&amp;sr=8-9) for the 13"" mbp, but both the ram/ssd is soldered on which is a bummer. both comes with 1 year warranty.

no longer do i have to stuff earbuds in my pocket and untangle them every time i wanna put them in. no longer will my zipper pull on the earbud cables and pull them out.

the light sensors on the airpods are amazing. the second i take one pod out anything i’m listening to is immediately paused.  the battery life has completely blown my expectations. they last 4-5 hours and charge in less than 15 minutes.

ex: remind me in 30 minutes to make it meeting room 6 etc...

shift gears and he starts upselling the phone's features.  i already locked into the flagship model so i don't know what there was to upsell..

after updating to ios 13,3 finally yesterday i started to notice that my airpods connections were getting wonky and i started getting exclamation marks(which apparently meant poor connection) alternating on my left and right airpods constantly. after probably an hour of not using it, i decided to take it out of the case again and i noticed that the right airpod stopped connecting. i did a reset on it twice by repairing the airpods. on the first reset i noticed that the right one started working again but this time the left airpod stopped connecting, so i tried again and second time did it both airpod started playing music from it and i thought it was fixed... or so i thought. over the next half an hour i noticed yet again the wonky connection yet again of the airpods which was cutting out once or twice as i was walking and after fidgeting with it a little more, i noticed that the left airpod’s ear detection wasn’t working. i opened my phone after putting my left airpods back into the case and i saw that the pop up said that the left one wasn’t charging. at this point i was just annoyed as music was still playing through the left one fine so i tried resetting it a couple of time and finally the left airpod stopped pairing and getting detected by my phone completely. slightly panicking i googled for more solutions and  started fidgeting with it more in an attempt to troubleshoot it and i realise that the little flicker that happens everytime you take the airpod out and put it back in stopped happening.  also i tried switching the left airpod of out of my old and fully functioning airpod which my younger sister now uses and it seemed that my phone detects the older left airpod and gave me a pop up notifying me of the switch while my newer left airpod which i was the one i was using was not responding to even one bit. i tried every solution i found online, cleaning it, blowing on it, letting it sit in the case for a minute, spam repairing the airpods and nothing worked. out of despair i contacted apple support and after much questions from them we determined that the left one might be faulty and issued a replacement. one thing that stood out during the conversation was the apple support person mentioning that people were having an issue with the airpods as well due to a software issue but at that point i was convinced that mine was faulty. i put my airpods away while also constantly checking on them for the next two~ three hours to see if anything changes and still it was my left airpod sitting dead in the case. i went to sleep shortly after 

and here i am 8 hours later( 16 hours after the whole ordeal) opening my airpod case to check on them again and guess what? my left airpod starts responding and working again. i am left really confused right now and i am at a lost of what to think. fortunately for me i have yet made the follow up to get my pods replaced.

***performance:*** geekbench 5/cinebench/unigine heaven/black magic/crystal disk mark 

geekbench 5 (cpu):

* average of 5 scores of x1gen7: **1045 (single-core)/3627 (multi-core)**
* average of 5 score of 13"" mbp: **1019 (single-core)/3881 (multi-core)**

cinebench 20 average of 5 (cpu):

* x1gen7: 1541
* 13"" mbp: 1663

black magic and crystal disk mark (ssd): 

mbps always had the fastest ssds and it's no different here. the 13"" mbp has similar (slightly slower) hard-drive speed as the 15"" model in the real-world file transfer tests done by laptopmag/tomshardware: [x1gen7](https://prnt.sc/qbu0kq)//[x1gen7](https://prnt.sc/qbu1b7)//[13"" mbp](https://prnt.sc/pzq9zo)///[13"" mbp](https://prnt.sc/pzqes4)

* crystal disk mark--x1gen7: 2633 mb/s read and 1862mb/s write (doesn't reflect real-world performance) 
* black magic--13"" mbp: 3094 mb/s read and 2881 mb/s write

3d mark fire strike (gpu):

* x1gen7: 1285
* 13"" mbp: 1632

cinebench 15r average of 5 (gpu):

* x1gen7: 22.7 fps/461 cb
* 13"" mbp: 35.19 fps/593 cb
* a gpu comparison from [notebookcheck.](https://www.notebookcheck.net/uhd-graphics-620-vs-iris-plus-graphics-645_8098_9902.247598.0.html)
* both aren't dedicated gpus, and aren't good enough for heavy gaming.

to conclude, both are comparable in terms of cpu performance and thermals (both around 89 degrees). however, the gpu in the 13"" mbp performances better (intel uhd 620 vs iris plus 645), along with a faster ssd.

***display:***

the highest i hit on my x1gen7's display is 356 nits, and 488 nits on my mbp. both essentially have the same resolution (2560 x 1440//2560 x 1600), and both support professional grade color-reproduction and wide gamut. however, the 13"" mbp's display is better, ranked at #4 (vs #11 of x1gen7) from [notebookcheck](https://www.notebookcheck.net/the-best-notebook-displays-as-reviewed-by-notebookcheck.120541.0.html). the 13"" mbp also has a 16:10 aspect ratio vs 16:9, giving it more room for scrolling/productivity. 

another upside of the 13"" mbp display is its image/text scaling. tldr, macos does a better job of scaling various image/text sizes. the reason why many professionals use macs is because of the better scaling and color consistency/calibration, especially since you’re working with higher resolution workflows and need to frequently rescale. it’ll be a lot wiser to have the better scaling from macos in this case. true tone is also useful when the ambient lighting changes in your surroundings, but for maximum color accuracy/consistency i'd recommend you to turn it off. the 13"" mbp display also has a better reflective coating and better viewing angles.

if you're getting the touchscreen:

touchscreen/touchbar wise both aren’t too useful in my opinion. with the touchscreen you can scroll/touch links i guess? but most of the time it‘s really awkward/annoying because i have to reach further from my keyboard when i’m working—which slows down my workflow—when i can just use the trackpad which is not only closer, but also more accurate/easier to use than touch. i also find that besides the scrolling here and there, i barely use it. also, it’s a huge fingerprint magnet and messes up your screen. touchbar is slightly better because you can customize your keys and it’s actually useful for some workflows, but the problem is that it lacks app support and it sometimes freezes/is more convenient to have physical keys most of the times.

***build/others***

thickness and weight wise, both are essentially the same (0.59 inch 2.9 pounds x1gen7/ 0.59 inch 3.02 pounds mbp). both are very well-built machines. the x1gen7 is made from a mix of magnesium and plastic (they call it ""carbon fiber"" but that's just another fancy way of saying plastic), and the 13"" mbp of 100% aluminum. both are very durable and solid machines, but i do prefer the 100% aluminum of the mbp a lot more. 

the difference between battery life is also significant (up to 3 hours more on the mbp). regarding performance when not plugged in, the x1gen7 can handle light usage like photo editing and media consumption without dropping in performance. but for more complicated tasks such as photoshop/video editing/light gaming, there is still a significant drop in performance (around 35-60% depending) when compared to the mbp that stays roughly the same (less than 10% drop) without being plugged in. as a result of constant charging for higher performance, the x1gen7’s battery deteriorates faster in the long run. my x1gen4's battery life has already dropped by roughly 50% (3-4 hours battery life), whereas my 2016 mbp still gives me over 8-9 hours on the same tasks.

it’s still clear to me that the track-pad and speakers on the mbp are a tier above other windows laptops. the track-pad on the x1gen7 is great, but it' still not as good or big as the one apple offers. speakers on the 13"" mbp are surprisingly loud and clear, compared to the audio on the x1gen7 that tends to get muddy on the low end, and static on the highs. keyboard wise, the 4th gen butterfly is very stable. personally, i never had an issue with them before--even with my 2016 mbp--and i enjoy the low-travel of the butterflies, however, the keyboard on the x1gen7 is top-tier, and i would say it's generally better for most people. the x1gen7 also has a much better port selection, and a replaceable ssd (although ram is soldered on). you can spend $30 more for a [port adapter](https://www.amazon.com/flujo-adapter-function-delivery-macbook/dp/b07y9rf9q4/ref=sr_1_9?crid=263uwyg375dv&amp;keywords=macbook+pro+port+adapter&amp;qid=1576612915&amp;sprefix=macbook+pro+port+ad%2caps%2c374&amp;sr=8-9) for the 13"" mbp, but both the ram/ssd is soldered on. both comes with 1 year warranty.  

to conclude, the 13"" mbp and the x1gen7 are one of the best ""non-pro"" ultra-books you can get. if you're looking for a high quality device for average usage with some light gaming on the side, then these are it. for heavier users, i would opt for the 16"" mbp or the thinkpad x1 extreme, since both of those have higher end cpus and dedicated gpus. however, if os isn't an issue (fine with macos or windows) and you're not using your laptop for heavy programs/games, then i would personally go for the 13"" mbp **since it has 3 hours more of battery life, a better display, better gpu, a better track-pad, and a faster ssd**\----but if you need the extra storage and want to add in your own, then the x1gen7 is the way to go. in general though, i'd recommend the 13"" mbp especially since it's $200 off right now at [b&amp;h](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1492879-reg/apple_muhp2ll_a_13_3_macbook_pro_with.html) for the holidays.",https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/ec1jbi/holiday_specials_13_macbook_pro_2019_vs_thinkpad/,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/ec1jbi/holiday_specials_13_macbook_pro_2019_vs_thinkpad/,ec1jbi,16,"(holiday specials) 13"" macbook pro (2019) vs thinkpad x1 carbon gen 7---an in-depth comparison w/ benchmarks.",0,"(holiday specials) 13"" macbook pro (2019) vs thinkpad x1 carbon gen 7---an in-depth comparison w/ benchmarks. this is a review of the 13"" mbp compared to the x1 carbon gen 7. both devices are on sale for the holidays.

***performance:*** geekbench 5/cinebench/unigine heaven/black magic/crystal disk mark 

geekbench 5 (cpu):

* average of 5 scores of x1gen7: **1045 (single-core)/3627 (multi-core)**
* average of 5 score of 13"" mbp: **1019 (single-core)/3881 (multi-core)**

cinebench 20 average of 5 (cpu):

* x1gen7: 1541
* 13"" mbp: 1663

black magic and crystal disk mark (ssd): 

mbps always had the fastest ssds and it's no different here. the 13"" mbp has similar (slightly slower) hard-drive speed as the 15"" model in the real-world file transfer tests done by laptopmag/tomshardware: [x1gen7](https://prnt.sc/qbu0kq)//[x1gen7](https://prnt.sc/qbu1b7)//[13"" mbp](https://prnt.sc/pzq9zo)///[13"" mbp](https://prnt.sc/pzqes4)

* crystal disk mark--x1gen7: 2633 mb/s read and 1862mb/s write (doesn't reflect real-world performance) 
* black magic--13"" mbp: 3094 mb/s read and 2881 mb/s write

3d mark fire strike (gpu):

* x1gen7: 1285
* 13"" mbp: 1632

cinebench 15r average of 5 (gpu):

* x1gen7: 22.7 fps/461 cb
* 13"" mbp: 35.19 fps/593 cb
* a gpu comparison from [notebookcheck.](https://www.notebookcheck.net/uhd-graphics-620-vs-iris-plus-graphics-645_8098_9902.247598.0.html)
* both aren't dedicated gpus, and aren't good enough for heavy gaming.

to conclude, both are comparable in terms of cpu performance and thermals (both around 89 degrees). however, the gpu in the 13"" mbp performances better (intel uhd 620 vs iris plus 645), along with a faster ssd.

***display:***

the highest i hit on my x1gen7's display is 356 nits, and 488 nits on my mbp. both essentially have the same resolution (2560 x 1440//2560 x 1600), and both support professional grade color-reproduction and wide gamut. however, the 13"" mbp's display is better, ranked at #4 (vs #11 of x1gen7) from [notebookcheck](https://www.notebookcheck.net/the-best-notebook-displays-as-reviewed-by-notebookcheck.120541.0.html). the 13"" mbp also has a 16:10 aspect ratio vs 16:9, giving it more room for scrolling/productivity. 

another upside of the 13"" mbp display is its image/text scaling. tldr, macos does a better job of scaling various image/text sizes. the reason why many professionals use macs is because of the better scaling and color consistency/calibration, especially since you’re working with higher resolution workflows and need to frequently rescale. it’ll be a lot wiser to have the better scaling from macos in this case. true tone is also useful when the ambient lighting changes in your surroundings, but for maximum color accuracy/consistency i'd recommend you to turn it off. the 13"" mbp display also has a better reflective coating and better viewing angles.

if you're getting the touchscreen:

touchscreen/touchbar wise both aren’t too useful in my opinion. with the touchscreen you can scroll/touch links i guess? but most of the time it‘s really awkward/annoying because i have to reach further from my keyboard when i’m working—which slows down my workflow—when i can just use the trackpad which is not only closer, but also more accurate/easier to use than touch. i also find that besides the scrolling here and there, i barely use it. also, it’s a huge fingerprint magnet and messes up your screen. touchbar is slightly better because you can customize your keys and it’s actually useful for some workflows, but the problem is that it lacks app support and it sometimes freezes/is more convenient to have physical keys most of the times.

***build/others***

thickness and weight wise, both are essentially the same (0.59 inch 2.9 pounds x1gen7/ 0.59 inch 3.02 pounds mbp). both are very well-built machines. the x1gen7 is made from a mix of magnesium and plastic (they call it ""carbon fiber"" but that's just another fancy way of saying plastic), and the 13"" mbp of 100% aluminum. both are very durable and solid machines, but i do prefer the 100% aluminum of the mbp a lot more. 

the difference between battery life is also significant (up to 3 hours more on the mbp). regarding performance when not plugged in, the x1gen7 can handle light usage like photo editing and media consumption without dropping in performance. but for more complicated tasks such as photoshop/video editing/light gaming, there is still a significant drop in performance (around 35-60% depending) when compared to the mbp that stays roughly the same (less than 10% drop) without being plugged in. as a result of constant charging for higher performance, the x1gen7’s battery deteriorates faster in the long run. my x1gen4's battery life has already dropped by roughly 50% (3-4 hours battery life), whereas my 2016 mbp still gives me over 8-9 hours on the same tasks.

it’s still clear to me that the track-pad and speakers on the mbp are a tier above other windows laptops. the track-pad on the x1gen7 is great, but it' still not as good or big as the one apple offers. speakers on the 13"" mbp are surprisingly loud and clear, compared to the audio on the x1gen7 that tends to get muddy on the low end, and static on the highs. keyboard wise, the 4th gen butterfly is very stable. personally, i never had an issue with them before--even with my 2016 mbp--and i enjoy the low-travel of the butterflies, however, the keyboard on the x1gen7 is top-tier, and i would say it's generally better for most people. the x1gen7 also has a much better port selection, and a replaceable ssd (although ram is soldered on). you can spend $30 more for a [port adapter](https://www.amazon.com/flujo-adapter-function-delivery-macbook/dp/b07y9rf9q4/ref=sr_1_9?crid=263uwyg375dv&amp;keywords=macbook+pro+port+adapter&amp;qid=1576612915&amp;sprefix=macbook+pro+port+ad%2caps%2c374&amp;sr=8-9) for the 13"" mbp, but both the ram/ssd is soldered on. both comes with 1 year warranty.  

to conclude, the 13"" mbp and the x1gen7 are one of the best ""non-pro"" ultra-books you can get. if you're looking for a high quality device for average usage with some light gaming on the side, then these are it. for heavier users, i would opt for the 16"" mbp or the thinkpad x1 extreme, since both of those have higher end cpus and dedicated gpus. however, if os isn't an issue (fine with macos or windows) and you're not using your laptop for heavy programs/games, then i would personally go for the 13"" mbp **since it has 3 hours more of battery life, a better display, better gpu, a better track-pad, and a faster ssd**\----but if you need the extra storage and want to add in your own, then the x1gen7 is the way to go. in general though, i'd recommend the 13"" mbp especially since it's $200 off right now at [b&amp;h](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1492879-reg/apple_muhp2ll_a_13_3_macbook_pro_with.html) for the holidays."
483,2538,1576605403,1,"hey guys,  


so i acidentally destroyed my xiaomi mix 2s, and now i'm back to using my old iphone se.  
about two years ago, i sold my macbook pro, ipad, and swore to never use apple again (after some warranty bullshit on my macbook).  


however, i forgot how pleasant it is to use ios. 'it just works' really is not an overstatement. there are so many nitpicks i had with my xiaomi phone that are simply not there on ios. that's why i'm planning to switch back to apple products.   


i need some advice from you guys though! so here are my questions:

\- my iphone se battery life is terrible. the battery condition is 86%, but i need to charge it twice a day to get through the day. will getting a replacement battery at an apple center bring it back to its old battery life? when it was new, it lasted about 2 days on a single charge.

\- i tried the airpods and was immediately in love. the sound quality and ergonomics are just fantastic. however, i tried it on my friends' iphone x. will the sound quality and easy of use be the same on my old iphone se?

\- which version of the apple watch would you guys recommend? i think gps, heartrate accuracy, and being able to use my smartwatch for music (either locally stored or spotify) during workouts is a big plus.

559,2832,1576364009,1,"i'm not an apple user, however, i keep a neutral stance about people using apple products and wanted to see if i could **be of help** to anyone buying the mac pro and see if they **could save money**, mainly in something that no one actually talks about which is upgradability. the mac pro has the option to upgrade cpu (i think), ram, ssd, and gpu. there are people, apple users, that may buy the mac pro since the imac pro leads to thermal issues (small space) and *only* has 18-cores at 256gb ram. i've read from subreddits that there are people that want to buy the mac pro but are hesitant due to the cost of the pro xdr display and apple's overpriced upgradability options on their website. i thought since the majority of the hardware is self-upgradable, why not buy them from amazon and see how much you save? that's what i tried to see if it were possible for apple users to save money on the mac pro and still get their mac pro-experience.

the gpu has been speculated - not real benchmarks or tests, but speculations on reddit and by [techpowerup](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/radeon-pro-vega-ii-duo.c3268)\- that it would be equal to the radeon rx 5700 xt. i've read from several subreddits that the **radeon pro vega ii duo is just an rx 5700 xt with much more vram (8gb vs 32gb)**, again they are speculations, not fact. furthermore, when it comes down to the rx 5700 xt it is already a powerful gpu that may help with acceleration while editing or using anything graphical-intensive on a mac, such as blender. the radeon pro vega ii duo might seem a bit overkill for some.

the ssd is not quite as fast as you would get from a samsung 970 evo plus, this was proven by [mkbhd](https://youtu.be/dopswcassu8?t=510) when he unboxed the mac pro; ssd speeds 2.7gb/s in read/write for the 4tb variant. since the mac pro has expansion slots, why not put in an **m.2 expansion card** and a **samsung 970 evo plus 2tb**?

the ram is very overpriced by apple, it jumps astronomically after 32gb. i went on amazon and newegg, and found ecc ram at the exact same frequency and the exact same amount for cheaper. a single 64gb ecc 2933mhz-dim on amazon costs $299.99 (6x 64gb = 384gb = **$1799.94**) but the same configurations costs **$6000** on apple's website. what?!

i believe the cpu is self-upgradable. apple's most expensive cpu is the xeon-w 24-core and xeon-w 28-core. the reason they are so special is that these two processors can support 2tb of ram while the others (16-core and lower) only support 1tb of ram, meaning 1.5tb would not be possible with the 16-core or lower variants. if someone buying the mac pro won't need 1.5tb of ram wouldn't this ""feature"" be a bit useless? that is why intel made two different cpu's:

the xeon w-3275m (28-core) and xeon w-3275 (28-core). the cache, pcie-lanes, and frequency are the same, but the supported ram is reduced by 1tb (meaning the xeon w-3275 only supports 1tb compared to 2tb on the m-variant). the cost difference between these two processors are ($4449 vs $7453 - intel's website). wouldn't the buyer save money by getting the normal non-m-variant when they know that they only need less than 1tb of ram?

i wanted to build the mac pro with base configuration but an included **apple afterburner** for those that are editors. the cpu is from **avadirect** and the rest are from **amazon (us)**. i choose these parts since they look ""realistic"" to be the most chosen configuration, in my opinion.

cpu: intel w-3265 (28-core) - **$4924.87**  
ram: **6x** supermicro 64gb ecc 2933mhz - **$299.99**

ssd: samsung 970 evo plus 2tb - **$499.97**  
expansion: aquacomputer kryo m.2 expansion card - **$51**

mac pro + custom config = $7999 + $7595 =\~ **$15,600**

i took it into an apple store a couple weeks ago where they gave it a blast with compressed air which worked for a day and then it’s just been bad ever since (this visit apparently wasn’t recorded against the serial number).

flash forward to today where i took it into a different store after doing some research on the keyboard repair program and they said basically because it’s over 4 years old (purchased june 2015) there’s nothing they could do and the only option i’ve got is to go back to the original  seller and go down the consumer law route. i can’t for the life of me find any proof of purchase or anything. 

the genius spoke to acs on live chat but they refused an exception. there was a previous case that i raised in feb 2017 reporting keyboard issues but he said that’s irrelevant as it’s over 4 years since purchase.

where do i stand with this? it is a known issue that this model has keyboard issues and the actual model is covered it’s just their stupid 4 year rule as i’m 6 months over they can’t help.

568,2854,1576346375,1,"hello! as a holiday promotion, my app [just timers](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/just-timers/id1453573845) is 50% off for unlimited timers from now through january 1st, 2020! 

[just timers](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/just-timers/id1453573845) is the missing timers app for ios. create multiple named timers for every day tasks like making coffee or tea, doing laundry, cooking and so much more! 

features:

* **multiple timers** - create as many timers as you need, overcoming the single timer limitation of ios. 
* **watch app** - create and manage timers on your wrist. an easy, simple ui to get your timers working for you.
* **siri shortcuts** - just say ""hey siri, start green tea"" to trigger your tea timer, or ""start laundry"" when you start a load. making a holiday roast? ""start roast beast!"" siri shortcuts allows you to easily manage your timers hands-free. this also extends into the shortcuts app, allowing you to interact with just timers with a series of other steps. 
* **today widget** - quickly glance at and manage your timers from the lock screen. 
* **nagging notifications** - missed the first notification? just timers can nag you a few more times to make sure you know when your timer is complete. 

i hope you find this app as useful as i do, it's a labor of love and i have some big plans ahead for it. i'd love your feedback/questions/suggestions to improve the app even further. 

some plans coming down the pipeline for version 2.0: 

* **shortcuts parameters** - instead of the current x-callback url scheme, i will be updating to support ios 13's new shortcut parameters, to simplify both the process of interacting with timers via the shortcuts app, but also adding support for conversational interactions with siri. *i'd love feedback on how you use shortcuts and what features i might be able to extend over the current shortcuts support to make this more useful*
* **interval timers** - whether it's for working out, or just working, intervals can be a handy way to kick off timers in succession. as one finishes, the next one starts. *i'm still working out some implementation details, so i'd love some feedback on how you might use this feature and any expectations from it.*
* **icloud support** - adding the ability to sync timers and timer states across devices, so you can keep track of your timer from anywhere.
* **standalone watch app** - up until watchos 6, apps needed a companion ios app to work. this will allow you complete independence from your phone, in combination with icloud support.
* **watch complication trigger** - when you tap the watch complication, currently it only opens the app. i have plans to let you assign a specific timer to start instead, giving you a quick trigger for your most frequent timer.
* **ui refresh** - i have some plans to refresh the ui across devices, utilizing the new swiftui framework and updating to support native dark mode instead of the current manual toggle.

earlier last year i made a mistake, i was using my 15-inch 2015 mbp in one of our labs and accidentally knocked it off the table. the bottom case bent but the laptop still worked fine, and i never really worried about it beyond that. a few months later i started experiencing some overheating issues and assumed it might have been related to my now bent laptop.

i took my 2015 to the apple store where they told me that there was nothing they could do and that i could recycle the computer if i wanted to…why would i recycle a laptop that still works, albeit bent and with some heating issues. 

so, i called apple support where they had me run diagnostics and then told me to send them some photos of my laptop through some file upload link they sent. there were some other phone calls trying to figure out what to do where i was had to talk to different supervisors in different departments and i was told they would email me when they figured it out. i was then contacted over email where i was told that they would be replacing my mbp and that details would follow.

hello, i just want to share my  experience.  it's been almost two months  and i still got no phone.  on march ten i started a replacement process  for a pixel 3 that had the usb port defective. sometimes recognized the  charger or accessories and sometimes didn't.  after waiting about three  to four days until google customer support could localize the phone  information linked to my account, they asked me if i wanted advanced  replacement or just sent the phone and wait till arrive on google  warehouses.  i took the advanced option, but still couldn't order the  phone over an error 500 that customer support never identified.  they  wrote me some troubleshooting steps with no success to resolve my  problem.

so i took the decision to  sent the phone to google and wait. the phone took over two weeks to get  to google because the customer service representative sent me  usps  labels and not fedex labels.  the phone arrived on april 16 2020 and i  wrote to customer service to notify it.   they reply me asking for  information about address and phone number which i provided it.  for my  surprise they can't just deliver the phone to the address that i  provide, because is not google maps verified  (maybe is because is on  puerto rico).  it's the same address that they sent the last device and  all my hardware from google store, so' it's been five days since they  last wrote me that they will write back.

so i took the decision to  sent the phone to google and wait. the phone took over two weeks to get  to google because the customer service representative sent me  usps  labels and not fedex labels.  the phone arrived on april 16 2020 and i  wrote to customer service to notify it.   they reply me asking for  information about address and phone number which i provided it.  for my  surprise they can't just deliver the phone to the address that i  provide, because is not google maps verified  (maybe is because is on  puerto rico).  it's the same address that they sent the last device and  all my hardware from google store, so' it's been five days since they  last wrote me that they will write back.

through  all this time i had to buy another phone because it's my only  communication method under this covid 19 quarantine.  thank you for reading."

i followed these steps, and it just added a a random generated code for google in my app.

**-throwaway, due to my normal account getting locked out for suspicious activity...**

i woke up last sunday to emails of suspicious activity reported on some of my accounts. as a safety measure i went to reset the password to my google account which appeared to work successfully. when i tried to login with the new password it wouldn't accept it. i went down the whole recovery process and google still would not let me back in.

i decided to try the backup email recovery which was tied to my ancient yahoo account. i don't recall my yahoo password, so i did a password recovery for that. well, it appears since i use google fi, and my account is locked out **i cannot receive sms messages from any other service except for google**. this makes sms password recovery impossible for other services in this situation!!

so here i am, almost a week later with no access to any google services that i paid for, and no customer support options. part of the google recovery asks for an alternate email to send status updates to, so i provide my work email.

i receive an email from google for an account recovery request with a link to check the status. when i click the link it says google could not verify it was me!

i later receive an email that just points back to the basic google recovery steps, which once again don't work. additionally, the email says ""we cant accept identification documents as proof of ownership"". **i use google fi, shouldn't there be an exception to this??**

i am completely flabbergasted as someone who has been a long time google supporter.

android has been my mobile os of choice since the galaxy s1 days.

**i am a google fi user, who cannot even use the service that i am paying for**

**i pay for the 200gb google drive for music**

**i pay for youtube premium/google music.**

my google account is the bearer of all my financial correspondences and has been my primary account for over 10 years, and it would be an extremely frustrating process to get everything migrated to a new email.

20 days later, the brand new pixel 3 crapped out. 

[screen went to total shit](https://ibb.co/bpppd26)

[basically seizure-inducing](https://gfycat.com/sizzlingqueasyfieldspaniel)

all just a few days after the walmart return period concluded. i went back to walmart and after seeing the video, the manager agreed to an exchange. turns out, there's no pixel 3s in stock anymore - four different walmarts, all zero stock.

my only choice was too contact google, and after reading all the reviews about their customer service here, i was not very excited to do it. 

contacted them, walked through the same bullshit basic steps again and they said ""yes after verifying your imei, you have an in-warranty device and we'll rma it"".

great but guess what? no advanced replacement. 

only devices bought directly from google qualify for this, despite the fact that they verified the imei, verified that it has warranty, verified that it's broken. despite the fact that i offered to have the hold put on my credit card without issue. traditional exchange only - send the device in, wait for replacement.

well what choice did i have? i rma'd it via standard exchange, told 5 - 10 days for a replacement. it took them three tries to get my name right on the address label, and it's a common name 🤦🏾‍♂️

what did google send me? a standard delivery label to ship it from one coast of canada to the other - not one-day, not two-day, not even expedited. a minimum, one week shipping process. and this is in a country that actually has google kiosks in best buy 🤦🏾‍♂️ wtf google

well it arrives at the google facility, more than halfway across the country, days pass and i hear nothing. 

i call google and they advise me, ""it's processing after which it will take another 5 - 10 days to receive your replacement"".

i’d like to start out by saying that the customer service i received from google was abysmal. they do not try to be helpful. they just try to get you off their back. 

after one year with my pixelbook, due to an accident 6 keys on my pixelbook were knocked off. as many of you know the fragility of these keys is a real problem. an especially strange design decision for a device that folds into a tablet. 

all i wanted to do was to get my keyboard repaired. i was happy to pay for this. the first time i called google told me that i should contact their repair service ubreakifix to get it repaired. upon calling them i was told that they only fix screens. so why did google send me on this wild goose chase? how did they not know this? apparently they did.

upon calling again i am told that i will need to take it to an unaffiliated repair shop. it seems crazy that that is their endorsed solution to a simple problem. as you can imagine, none of these shops could find the parts i need because google doesn’t sell them. 

so here i am unable to fix what would be a $50 problem on any other laptop, calling back again. so what do they tell me? i’m sorry, there’s nothing we can do.

&amp;#x200b;

according to tech statistics website built with, more than 650,000 websites are already using recaptcha v3; overall, there are at least 4.5 million websites use recaptcha, including 25% of the top 10,000 sites. google is also now testing an enterprise version of recaptcha v3, where google creates a customized recaptcha for enterprises that are looking for more granular data about users’ risk levels to protect their site algorithms from malicious users and bots. 

**but this new, risk-score based system comes with a serious trade-off: users’ privacy.** 

according to two security researchers who’ve studied recaptcha, one of the ways that google determines whether you’re a malicious user or not is whether you already have a google cookie installed on your browser. it’s the same cookie that allows you to open new tabs in your browser and not have to re-log in to your google account every time. but according to mohamed akrout, a computer science phd student at the university of toronto who has studied recaptcha, it appears that google is also using its cookies to determine whether someone is a human in recaptcha v3 tests. akrout wrote in [an april paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.01003.pdf) about how recaptcha v3 simulations that ran on a browser with a connected google account received lower risk scores than browsers without a connected google account. “if you have a google account it’s more likely you are human,” he says. google did not respond to questions about the role that google cookies play in recaptcha. 

**to make this risk-score system work accurately, website administrators are supposed to embed recaptcha v3 code on** ***all*****of the pages of their website, not just on forms or log-in pages.** 

then, recaptcha learns over time how their website’s users typically act, helping the machine learning algorithm underlying it to generate more accurate risk scores. because recaptcha v3 is likely to be on every page of a website,  if you’re signed into your google account there’s a chance google is getting data about every single webpage you go to that is embedded with recaptcha v3—and there many be no visual indication on the site that it’s happening, beyond a small recaptcha logo hidden in the corner. 

this kind of cookie-based data collection happens elsewhere on the internet. giant companies use it as a way to assess where their users go as they surf the web, which can then be tied into providing better targeted advertising. for instance, **google’s recaptcha cookie follows the same logic of the facebook “like” button when it’s embedded in other websites—it gives that site some social media functionality, but it also** **lets facebook know that you’re there****.** 

previously, google has said that the data captured from recaptcha is not used for ad targeting or analyzing user interests and preferences. after this story was published, google said that the information collected through recaptcha will not be used for personalized advertising by google. 

# so to sum it up..

the way that recaptchas work is that they track your online activities in a way. google compiles the data collected from users that are selecting images in order to prove that they are human and puts it in a library that can be used to monitor how the internet is being used on a regular basis, **and there is a lot of controversy surrounding the anonymity of this data as well as the fact that google is basically profiting off of people proving that they are not bots whilst not giving them an option to opt out of what is essentially a data collection scheme.** 

google has stated that it is in no way trying to exploit users, but several users have reported that using google chrome in the incognito mode results in a much more complicated recaptcha process compared to when they use the regular version which shows that google is using some kind of tracking to figure out whether or not you are a bot.

i've been working on a new side project to bring a new ui to google tasks. this project is under heavy development and any contributions are appreciated.

some interesting points about the app:
 * web and electron app ui
 * support for subtasks
 * all tasks view
 * dark mode support
 * auto save

the list will grow more and i'll work to make it an even cooler app.
i'll appreciate feedback and i welcome everybody to help by raising bugs, features or with code.

can not downgrade, as this is the google app with june 2019 pie security patch. sony xperia xzp, stock 9.0 rom. if also affected my partner's xperia xa2, running the same version (june 2019 9.0) - however she doesn't rely on or use automation apps like myself.

it's hard to explain the symptoms so directly as they are hard to spot. even though i am vigilant to it, it still catches me out. it really does weird out normal behaviour to a really, creepy factor. i honestly thought it was malware two years ago.

full break down;

* using tasker and any tasker plugins using broadcast api to communicate; autowear, watchmaker, tinycam pro are just a handful. klwp does, too, i believe; are affected. they will either silently fail, or timeout. it may affect other automation apps depending on system broadcasts for events.


* can not disable device administrators. can enable them, but disabling them greys them out until a reboot (or disabling google app).


* 3rd party sms apps struggle to know of messages they sent as the intent sent back from android is delayed. chomp, textra and others suffered. this is especially noticeable if you use delivery reports.


* notifications from apps that rely on system broadcasts may be delayed by upto 15 minutes; this includes fcm/push notifications. ifttt, hangouts and others are just some examples.


* play store downloads hang at 99 or 100% for upto 15 mins.


* other issues i may not be aware of.

i explicitly stated in the app settings that my preferred language is italian and my region is italy, so i really don't understand why i keep receiving notifications about megan rapisomething doing literally anything or about a politician (i think) named pelato (which means ""hairy"" in my language btw) doing something related to us politics which i don't even understand or care about at all.

anyone knows if there's another setting i should set or any other way to fix this?"

i don't tend to write may reviews but though this one was worth it 

i have had the google pixel 2 and 2 google pixel 3's and the phones are amazing. very smooth software and stellar camera and they are very simple to use like iphone but with more customisability. everything integrates with accessories like google pixel wireless stand and earbuds but my issue is there is too much battery drain when you leave mobile data on compared to huawei and apples products. 

google home is a great smart speaker which is good for questions and to play music and just someone to speak to when your bored. the speaker sounds really good and syncs with pixel phone to easily send information across devices so if i ask how long will it take to get somewhere, it will have sent the directions to my phone. only disadvantage so far is sometimes the mics don't pick up they ""hey google"" if your in a big room. 

google chromecast has had some neat updates to work better with apps and google assistant and is just very easy to stream some netflix or bbc iplayer to your tv and i find it quicker than to use a tv remote because navigating is often harder and chromecast can make any hdmi tv smart for only £30

google pixel wireless stand is a fast wireless charger which i think is faster than samsung's and has a pretty ui when the pixel 3 is docked where it tells you the time and weather, notification icons, battery percent and google assistant always ready. plugs in through usb-c so if your in a rush you can unplug the wireless charger and plug right into your phone.

in order to share files from one mobile to another mobile, you have to depend on some third party app. google has come with the files go, but just like everything else, the files go has its limits. the files go allows you to share only up to 1gb at a time, which can be considered a drawback for the files go. but as it happens, google has decided to push the limits of file sharing. the new file sharing app that google is working on is called, the fast share.

&amp;#x200b;

https://i.redd.it/i847q1wqbi731.jpg

  

as the name suggests, we might expect the fast share to be really fast. and, the most interesting thing about this app is that this is going to be google’s competition for apple’s airdrop. you can send the files or apps or photos or anything you want, by just selecting the item and then choosing the fast share option from the share tab that appears. but, the drawback is that this app only accepts the sharing of files from the android phones that contain google play services. we are sure that the remaining devices that don’t have the google play services installed, can’t run this app. another thing that i am sure about is that this app requires the bluetooth and the wifi direct support to run.

&amp;#x200b;

https://i.redd.it/p6b35thtbi731.jpg

  

the activity currently shows generic share targets, including a chromebook, a pixel 3, an iphone, and a smartwatch. hopefully, the service will actually support sending files to chrome os devices, apple ios devices, and wear os smartwatches once it goes live, but we can’t say for sure just based on the presence of these generic share targets. hope we can see this sharing feature soon from google.

i haven’t tried a pixel phone yet but they look intriguing as hell. my biggest motivation for this is trying to get out of apples ecosystem as google definitely does look like the greener grass so to speak. 

i definitely like google assistant and the power it has and that’s by far blowing alexa and siri out of the water. i like how well it integrates on a pixel and how well it can run on android.

the wife is also an apple user and we share icloud calendars and use find my friends and of course she loves her imessage. is there any relatively painless way to break the ecosystem and have her still be happy on iphone and me switch to google and android or is this like trying to fight and endless war?

i would do the same for anyone, regardless if i agree with their  political views or not, everyone should be entitled to air them freely.  
 

if you disagree with this way of thinking, then it is you who is the bigot and the fascist.  it really is that simple.   


before anyone asks, i'm a centerist.  but of course, this will not matter a jot to the ultra left and their black and white thinking, where anyone who isn't of them, is their enemy.   


if you do nothing to stand up for the person next you whose being silenced, who will stand up for you when they knock on your door."

don't fall for fake
it’s important to help kids become aware that people and situations online aren’t always as they seem. discerning between what’s real and what’s fake is a very real lesson in online safety.
know the signs of a potential scam
if statements about “winning” or getting something for “free” feel too good to be true, they most likely are.
fair exchanges shouldn’t involve giving away any personal information.
always think critically before acting online and learn to trust your intuition. be on guard for phishing attempts—efforts to steal information like login or account details by pretending to be a trusted contact in an email, text, or other online communication.

my google **family group was disabled and my youtube account was terminated** due to violations of the terms. i have absolutely no idea what i have done wrong, i have never uploaded a single youtube video in my life, and i don't comment on any other content.   
the only people who use this service are my girlfriend, my brother and my parents.  
i don't understand how my account can simply be terminated like that without giving a reasonable explanation.  how can customers be treated like this? i just recently switched from spotify to youtube premium...  
like i said **i have no idea what i could have possibly done to violate the terms and conditions**..   
i filed a request to restore the account asking for an explanation but this is the only response i got:  
*thank you for your account suspension appeal. we have decided to keep your account suspended based on our community guidelines and terms of service. please visit http://www.youtube.com/t/community\_guidelines for more information.*  
i have been a loyal google customer for over 10 years now, and in my opinion i havn't violated any of youtube's policies. i tried contacting support via phone however no one seems to be able to give me an explanation as to why it was terminated. the only suggestion i got was to create a new account which is ridiculous because this is my main gmail account. why should i create a new one? 

to top it off i cant file another appeal to reactivate my account because i get an automated reply stating that i already sent an inquiry and that the response is final.

1068,4835,1560294261,0,"so i currently have an iphone x, but i'm due for an upgrade and i'm looking to make the switch back to android after a long time. i've narrowed down my options to 3 phones:

· samsung galaxy s10
· samsung galaxy s10 plus
· google pixel 3 xl

i hear the pixel has a really great interface and is very smooth compared to other androids. but it seems that the galaxy has a superior display and better hardware (better processor, more ram) than the pixel. 

now here's where the decision gets a little interesting: i can get either galaxy phone on my current verizon deal where i can upgrade every year (i'm essentially leasing the phone, but can keep it for 2 years if i want to buy it). but if i went with the pixel, then i'd have to buy it out and i'd have it for 2 years before i can upgrade. my question is if the 3 xl would still be a good phone in 2 years, or if i'm better off going with the galaxy s10 for a year and then maybe getting a pixel 4? 

i also use a decent number of google apps and would love to use more. i know the pixel is obviously the best for that, but how would the galaxy stack up? similar to my iphone? and i have an apple watch, so i'd like whichever phone i get to work well with an android smartwatch. 

i'd love to hear your guys' opinions and your experiences with any of these phones. sorry for the long post! thanks in advance",https://www.reddit.com/r/google/comments/bzjiks/pixel_3_xl_or_galaxy_s10/,https://www.reddit.com/r/google/comments/bzjiks/pixel_3_xl_or_galaxy_s10/,bzjiks,0,pixel 3 xl or galaxy s10?.,0,"pixel 3 xl or galaxy s10?. so i currently have an iphone x, but i'm due for an upgrade and i'm looking to make the switch back to android after a long time. i've narrowed down my options to 3 phones:

· samsung galaxy s10
· samsung galaxy s10 plus
· google pixel 3 xl

i hear the pixel has a really great interface and is very smooth compared to other androids. but it seems that the galaxy has a superior display and better hardware (better processor, more ram) than the pixel.

you get the point. google should have a park. it would be a theme park with rides, but it would also be unlike any other. it would be focused on google, and the heart of it would googliness, technology, doing good, and treating everyone equally. this means you can't pay more to get special treatment at the park, like paying for a private tour that gets you onto rides extra fast. there could still be employee days during the week that are reserved for employees and their guests. maybe everyone can skip 3 lines per day that they have an admission ticket. maybe all food and drink is free. (included in the cost) maybe there are discounts for those who struggle to afford the park, or free days, or coupon days, or something. google would use technology to direct people to activities that don't have long lines, perhaps with google glass. and google wouldn't be afraid to build two or three of the same ride, activity, or display if it has excess demand. 100% powered by renewable energy. all packaging will be fully recyclable or washable and reusable, and will be recycled.

**google park** could be the core, but it could expand out to many other areas, either over time, or right away. because of this, it should be in an area with a lot of (reasonably cheap) open land, and google should perhaps own more land than they at first think they will need, because of possible future expansion.

theme parks engender brand loyalty for kids and adults alike. google could run the park at cost because of this, or even at a small loss as part of its branding efforts.

the rides would (of course) be exceptionally designed, and include vr and ar experiences, as well a roller coasters with both futuristic and retro themes.

the park could also have a learning element like tech world (see below), only less focused on it. it could have portions where you learn how google works, how to search better using lesser known search operators, etc. these would be less in-depth than tech world, but both the park and any additional attractions could have little stations that feature the other attractions so that they all feed into each other. little teasers so that people are enticed to visit everything that the greater google park areas have to offer.

&amp;#x200b;

the additional attractions that could be connected but separate from the park... could be some of the following, or others:

**google's stem world**, or **google's tech world** \- this would feature demonstrations and semi-permanent exhibitions of how technology works, as well as leading edge feats of science, genetics, nanoparticles, engineering, and math. it could include [millenium prize problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/millennium_prize_problems) (math), as well as x-prizes and prizes that google would offer for visitors who can improve an algorithm or find a bug, both in live code or in fun, simulated environments. this world would give visitors information to take in, but also be interactive with learning stations for learning coding, math, and science. kids could do science experiments at one station, and build their own logic circuits at the next. it would also focus on teaching people how google works.

**google's bot kingdom** \- dedicated to personal, commercial, and industrial robots, both from google and other companies, from local tech startups and giants and from around the world.

**google's x adventure** \- this would focus not only on the extreme moonshots that google has worked on and is working on, but also on crazy moonshots that others are attempting or perhaps ones that people should be considering attempting. it would also feature an ideas suggestion box that would regularly be checked, and certain ideas would win people prizes with the occasional idea getting pursuit from google. people must physically be at the park to submit their ideas. but there would be both paper and digital submission avenues.

**google's ai pavilion** (could be multiple pavilions) - shows ai in all its forms. including the latest from waymo, and work from researchers all over the world. perhaps it poo-poos the way apple has been so secretive with their ai research. it has onsite tpus and graphics cards that are always humming with workloads that visitors can put on them, free of charge, to test whatever is on their mind. there would be stations to teach people ai techniques from beginner to advanced.

**google's computing history museum** \- goes deep into the ancient roots of computing, and then all the way up to present day - with projections about the future of computing. explains the exponential progress of computing with moore's law and other ""laws"" that have improved things like memory, storage, network speeds, etc. shows plenty of actual hardware, both running and unplugged, ancient and modern. it focuses on getting the old hardware in particular up and running, but it would display cutting edge computers such as experimental quantum computers, running for everyone to observe.

our instructor made a point of emphasizing the concept of ""naming your category."" according to him, this was the holy grail of marketing and a goal for any campaign to pursue.

naming your category is basically when you dominate the market so hard in a certain area that your product essentially becomes the representative of its category in the consumer lexicon. for instance:

instead of saying ""tissues,"" people say ""kleenex""
instead of saying ""gelatin dessert,"" people say ""jell-o""
instead of saying ""stun gun,"" people say ""taser""
instead of saying ""bandage,"" people say ""band-aid""
...and so on, so forth. in every single instance, the specific product name has become synonymous with the category it falls under, even when used to refer to the same product distributed by a different company or brand.

why do i bring this up? it occurs to me that google has done just that. the company has become a verb. ""google it."" ""why don't you just google it?"" you get the idea.

in fact, these phrases are most often used when knowledge must be confirmed or denied. a factual truth. determined by this verb. not ""look it up,"" or ""research it,"" because if that were the case, the phrase wouldn't be used the way it is now. no, the implication is that once you have taken this single step, you are finished. nothing more can be said on the matter.

in the chrome and in the edge the google appears strange... and it is slow af. the strangest thing is it misses some of the functions: there are no tools, so i can't search by language or date. at the image-search the design is also different. the tools are also missing there, so no options for searching by size or color. and the whole page uses only the left of the screen. in ff it works just fine.

\-flushdns

\-disable chrome-addons

\-reinstall

\-delete the history

&amp;#x200b;

i have a problem with google search at home. i'm now in the office, no problem here.

in the chrome and in the edge the google appears strange... and it is slow af. the strangest thing is it misses some of the functions: there are no tools, so i can't search by language or date. at the image-search the design is also different. the tools are also missing there, so no options for searching by size or color. and the whole page uses only the left of the screen. in ff it works just fine.

&amp;#x200b;

i tried to:

\-flushdns

\-disable chrome-addons

\-reinstall

\-delete the history

 i search google for this, and i saw many cases like mine too, some of them have all the information that google requires but still can't get their account back.

so what the h\*ck, why you guy even create this function anyway, it is a f\*cking useless one. and when it couldn't verify me already, why the f\*ck it ask for my external email for? , just to show me with the super insane velocity speed that you guy ""couldn't verify this account belongs to you""."

also it's simply unusable on windows. because of some unexplainable reason one of the biggest internet concerns isn't able to make a usable volume slider. why not just use the one from youtube? the youtube music volume slider in a windows browser only goes from 100% to 50%. the lowest volume is literally 50% which is way too loud for background listening while talking to people on discord. and it's not even stepless like the youtube slider, it's only like 10 big steps.

&amp;#x200b;

when will youtube music finally get even remotely competitive and usable? i want to love it but it's impossible and literally unusable for me."

1181,5402,1559252446,0,"ok, here me out, and i'm sorry this is a little long. so i won't call myself a fanboy - but i am definitely a fan of the company. however, now i can feel my enthusiasm starting to wane. google has brought a lot of big tech-related watershed moments for me but it's hard for me to deny that their business models are becoming harder and harder to support.

the move from using portals, primitive search engines (shoutout to metacrawler), and damned webrings to google felt like a huge leap forward. a few years later, i remember being blown away by the 1gb storage gmail was offering in comparison to the 10mb of their competitors. my colleagues and i spent time sending 10 mb attachments to see if gmail would actually allow 1gig in our inbox and sure enough, they weren't lying. and of course the past decade has been filled with some inspiring (and sometimes frustrating) things like the advent of chrome, android, google assistant/google home, etc.

so i'm not trying to be hyperbolic but i can't help but feel the tide is beginning to shift. here are just a few of my gripes

1. the continued disconnect between google's various products. i don't even know where to begin with this, but from the superfluous messaging apps to the inconsistent design language across their suite to the unpredictable introduction and sun-setting of products and features with no decent alternative (i'm looking at you inbox, gpm, etc)... it's just been maddening for the end-user

1. the increasing failure to reach any semblance of parity in market share for flagship phones that aren't from samsung (and the inability for the pixel line to make a dent... here's to hoping the pixel 3a can make some inroads in the mid-range market). i know they don't directly have control over how the market shakes out but it seems like we have a lot of the cons of a ""diverse"" market without the pros. for instance, there seems to be more fragmentation than representation in the marketplace. and even when they introduce a product where they have the potential to be a market leader, they seem to be only semi-committed and we are left with half baked products like their tablet and wearos solutions.

1. chrome - especially their stance on ad-blockers. this has been somewhat the tipping point for me - the reported rumors of ad-blockers possibly no longer working on future versions of chrome seem to be a slap in the face of the spirit of why i appreciated chrome in the first place. not to mention that they seem to be doing everything the can to subtly cripple competing browsers by degrading their performance on their platforms like youtube

these are just some of the things that have been bugging me lately. don't get me wrong, in most ways my life is enriched by google and their products (along with those of their competitors and contemporaries), but it's beginning to feel like microsoft in the mid 2000s... where they were too big to fail so they just became less and less relevant (although i'm intrigued by ms's possible newfound momentum). in the grand scheme of things, i'm just nitpicking on something relatively minor - but it's a shame to see something i appreciate become less competent over time.

perhaps they really are living long enough to become the villain...",https://www.reddit.com/r/google/comments/buyybb/has_google_jumped_the_shark/,https://www.reddit.com/r/google/comments/buyybb/has_google_jumped_the_shark/,buyybb,0,"has google ""jumped the shark""?.",0,"has google ""jumped the shark""?. ok, here me out, and i'm sorry this is a little long. so i won't call myself a fanboy - but i am definitely a fan of the company. however, now i can feel my enthusiasm starting to wane. google has brought a lot of big tech-related watershed moments for me but it's hard for me to deny that their business models are becoming harder and harder to support.

the move from using portals, primitive search engines (shoutout to metacrawler), and damned webrings to google felt like a huge leap forward. a few years later, i remember being blown away by the 1gb storage gmail was offering in comparison to the 10mb of their competitors. my colleagues and i spent time sending 10 mb attachments to see if gmail would actually allow 1gig in our inbox and sure enough, they weren't lying. and of course the past decade has been filled with some inspiring (and sometimes frustrating) things like the advent of chrome, android, google assistant/google home, etc.

received call again 5th or 6th time and i finally answered this call and got a repeated access code and nothing else.
""""i received a text message before the call which was - g-210473 is your google verification code.""""""
and the automated voice said the same access code as in that text message and instructed not to share it with anyone.
check few forums on internet, someone mentioned that it's the way these scammers get access to your phone💀

1) google itself now looks like someone vomited out a box of lucky charms all over the screen. gone are the clean text results. instead we get image results, sales results icons, forum results and all manner of whacky things.

2) clicking those links often doesn't take you to the page, but to some weird google ""amp"" link that's nigh on impossible to get rid of. why?

3) and then, on mobile you click the url, and it hides the location bar, a 20 year standard, and replaces it with a weird ""edit button"". yes i did want to edit the url thanks, hence why i clicked it.

4) even selecting to copy and paste on mobile is hit and miss, with the copy dialogue showing up 70% of the time.

5) then they killed off inbox, which was one of their actually good services and forced everyone back onto gmail. great if you want to get actual ads served up virtually indistinguishable from emails, right when you're working.

6) and the gmail app has a really strange feature where new emails being written are *new instances of the app*, so when you hit send, the whole screen just spontaneously disappears. that is your confirmation that the email is sent.

7) gsuite often simply has broken links. it's like someone didn't bother to hook up some functionality there.

i'm trying to make a list of ""flip-a-switch"" features that google doesn't roll out globally. i'm not talking about things like call screening or other stuff that takes work or some kind of permission / allowance from other countries before they can roll it out. that's totally understandable something like that take time. what i'm trying to call out is ""flip-a-switch"" features which i have made a list of underneath. 

please add more ""flip-a-switch"" features and i will edit the thread with them. 

my idea is that we call google out on this, so they see how important it's for many people, that we get a wider roll-out of the features that are easy to roll out, but just hold back because who knows why. 

so i think we all should post this list several places, to grab googles attention. hopefully it could get some attention from android news sites, how bad google is to roll features out globally compared to apple etc. 

i think the best place to post is on twitter. this won't really spam their page, as it will only show up if they answer, which i don't think they will. but we might still get their attention. 

so either post on their wall or tag them in a post. if the post is too long, either make it over several times and writeb ""1/3"" ""2/3"" ""3/3"" in your post at the start or take a picture of this post and crop it to show the examples.

• google pay is released on the phone, but blocked on wearos in many countries. if you launch it for phone, why doesn't you also release it for your smartwatches? the groundwork here is obviously done.
• stop is a universal word, but the new stop alarm feature to google home is for english only.
• copy everything in multi-task screen on pixel devices only works in english. 
• routines for google home doesn't work in every language. 
• ""ok google"" hotword only work in english on my phone. yes, google assistant is released in my language. why does ""ok google"" work for my smart speaker, but not my phone? 
• google assistant rollout for all devices. why is google assistant not consistently on all my devices. been on my phone and smart speaker for 8 months. been on wearos for 3 months in my language. not available on either chromebook or android tv."
